Cody ordered. The ship slowed, the stars became more visible. He watched the ring’s readings.\n\nBuckling on number five, Ellaz thought. The single ring was composed of twenty segments, connected by forty flexible couplings. Segment Five was overheated and its shape was distorting, throwing its section of warp out of alignment with the others.\n\nHeat up six and four, Cody thought. Ellaz complied, reducing the coolants running to those two segments. They expanded, nearly pushing against Segment Five. It brushed against them and the warp field changed.\n\nOkay, Cody thought, Warp Nine.\n\n!! From Ellaz.\nassistant\nKey characters include Edie, Ellaz, and Cody. They are in a space simulation where their ship is escaping from a mass and avoiding debris and matter storms. They face a critical situation when the warp ring fails, requiring quick decision-making to stabilize the ship. Edie calls the days of their simulated journey, and the passage ends as they realize the severity of their impending danger."}]}

She’d seen the plans for the ships and approved. “Ninety days on ECLSS — that’s doable.”\n\n“They’re rated for a full year,” Cody pointed out.\n\n“You know, there’s a reason ships carry four separate units,” Nora objected. Then she sighed. “But we can’t build bigger. Not in time.” Then she shot Cody a look. “I’m taking the babies.”\nassistant\nCody offers Nora the position of First Officer on the Hope, but the offer comes with a secret: Edie and Jazzy, the pilots, are not compatible at Warp Nine, so Edie will only fly at Warp Five. The Hope and Revenge, the other ship, will take different routes to their destination to avoid unnecessary risk. Nora agrees to the arrangement, but is surprised by the need to keep this knowledge from others."}]}

They practiced loading the ships, working weight and balance, launching the ships from their cradles, running through startup procedures, and engaging the warp drive.\n\nNora was brilliant. So were all her suggestions. Jacob and Gail were thrilled to be appointed as Ellaz’s and Cody’s official assistant, rated Ensign. They were also so frazzled that they blew the sim three times before Edie called a break.\n\n“Hey,” she told them, “making mistakes is how you learn. Don’t beat yourselves up.”\n\nThe two kids nodded. Cody smiled at them and even Ellaz managed a grateful look.\n\nThey sent the crew of Hope off to lunch, took a quick break themselves, and then it was time for Revenge.\n\n“Perhaps you’d care to tell us why we’re both on this ship?” Clive Bamber said, pointing to his wife.\n\n“Also why we’ve got so many rations?” Brenda Hogg — Captain Hogg — added.\n\n“Redundancy,” Edie Crump replied. “Jazzy and I are ringing the ship.”\n\n“Ringing?” Moira repeated. “You mean, you’re handling the ring?” She glanced to her husband. “Why?”\n\n“Because this is a single ring warp,” Edie said. “And while we’ve got two ships… that’s all we’ve got.”\n\n“And we have to warn people,” Brenda agreed.\n\n“And get help,” Clive added, waving a hand toward the distant moon, Nettles.\n\n“Warp Nine is hard,” Edie said. She made a face. “In sims we discovered that Jazzy and I… well, we’re not up to Warp Nine.”\n\n“So what can you handle?” Moira Collins demanded. “And is there anyone who can help?”\n\n“No one here has implants,” Edie explained. “Just running the ring in VR won’t cut it, particularly as these rings are new.”\n\n“And we couldn’t just build or use old rings?” Moira asked.\n\n“We don’t have the time,” Clive told her.\n\n“To warn the others?”\n\n“Here,” Clive told her. “We can consume our rations here or we can take them with us. But, at some point, they’re going to run out.”\n\n“So we need to get help,” Moira guessed. “So… what else?”\n\n“We’re going to Quark,” Edie said. “We’ll go at Warp Five. We’ve got charts for that. Eighty-two days, twelve hours.”\n\n“And Hope?” Clive asked.\nassistant\nKey characters include Jacob, Gail, Nora, Edie Crump (Captain Hogg), Jazzy, Clive Bamber, Brenda Hogg, Moira Collins, and Moira's husband. The passage describes the crew of the Hope preparing for a mission, encountering redundancies, and planning to reach Quark via Warp Five."}]}

Cody and Ellaz stuck around long enough to be certain that everything was working, then they left with Gail and Jacob in tow.\n\n#\n\nThe biggest problem was the babies, of course.

Rather, mother was. I was watching in our room. Mom presented “An Investigation Into The Possibilities Of Complete Energy Conversion.”\n\nSo the aliens heard about that?\n\nNot… aliens, Ellaz replied after a moment. Cody, what if someone wanted to steal the energy converter?\n\nBut they didn’t, Cody thought. You still have it. Right?\n\nI… do, Ellaz admitted. But it was damaged, so I hid it. It’s safe. The materials fused. They’re inert now.\n\nOkay, so either someone wanted to steal it and brought an attack that killed fifteen hundred million people or —\n\nThere are aliens, Ellaz replied. Maybe there are.\n\nBut why would they want the energy converter?\n\nThey didn’t, Ellaz thought with a chilling certainty. Someone else did.\n\nSomeone —!? Cody was silent. Finally, Ellaz, are you saying that there’s a traitor? That someone sold us out to aliens so that they could get the energy converter?\n\nOr keep others from getting it, Ellaz thought back.\n\nThere’s a traitor, Cody thought. A traitor with tech no one else has —\n\nMaybe the aliens, Ellaz replied. Maybe he swapped them for it.\n\nBut how did they know?\n\nThe Symposium was announced months — nearly a full year — before, Ellaz replied. Everyone was there. Mom was looking for funding. We were at our limit, almost broke.\n\nI thought you Whirly’s were rich!\n\nWere, Ellaz agreed. The energy converter — it was very expensive. And the research before, even worse.\n\nA warp bubble, Cody thought. If it were possible, the alien could just pop on the ship, and pop back off — the ship could explode around it and it would be protected by the bubble.\n\nYes, Ellaz agreed wearily.

She accepted his arm in support, though.\n\n#\nassistant\nKey characters include Cody, Ellaz, and their mother (referred to as \"mom\"). Ellaz discusses concerns over an energy converter being stolen, suggesting potential traitors within their group. This leads to speculation about aliens potentially involved, threatening everyone's safety. Cody becomes unwell during a simulation. The story concludes with Ellaz needing rest and Cody assisting her."}]}

Cody drew in a quick breath — that’s what the alien had done — he had killed Elle Whirly, the inventor of the energy converter. Did he know about Ellaz? Or did he think she didn’t know enough, or was too young to understand her mother’s secret? Did he know that Ellaz had an implant?

They weren’t all that different from the overalls they had, he decided, so he could wear them in the pilot’s seat.\n\nGail got him settled into a bed, pulled a privacy curtain around him and dimmed the lights.\n\n“Four hours, no more!” Cody ordered.\n\n“Aye Captain,” Gail said, giggling.\n\n#\n\nCody woke when the ship lurched around him. He pulled down the privacy curtain and scrambled to the flight deck, grabbing his helmet as a wide-eyed Gail passed it to him. “Strap down!”\n\nHe got to his seat and pulled on his helmet. Ellaz? No answer. Ellaz!\n\nHere! I’m here! Ellaz replied a moment later, slapping his hand with hers. It just came out of nowhere!\n\nCody could see it. They had swerved around one dark clump of matter and now — Pull up! He put his mind to work and they pulled the ship up and up. He felt the ship strain to change position and then, slowly, Hope rose in the nothing of warp space. A moment later, Cody checked their view forward and blew out a sigh of relief.\n\nAnd you didn’t see it coming? Cody thought to Ellaz. She didn’t reply. Ellaz?\n\nUm… I might have dozed off, Ellaz confessed. I was working on my project and I lost track of time.\n\nProject? Cody repeated. Are you trying to figure out a new way to beat me at 3D chess?\n\nEllaz scoffed. No! Why would I?\n\nWell, I did beat you once, Cody reminded her. Although, truth be told, he thought she was off form for that last game. Distracted. Tired.\n\nFifty-seven more hours, right? Ellaz thought, pointing to the mission timer. We didn’t lose any with that swerve?\nassistant\nKey characters include Gail, Cody, and Ellaz. The passage shows Cody receiving care from Gail after waking up, changing into new clothes, and preparing for a mission. Later, the ship experiences a sudden maneuver, and Cody interacts with Ellaz through their ship's communication system. Cody and Ellaz discuss the recent event and Cody's chess-playing habit."}]}

Despite time running short, Ellaz reveals that they were tracking the radiation to find their way to Deneb, while Cody questions the extent of the damage. Ellaz admits she is dying and offers a chess program linked to her memory as a potential way to reach Deneb. Cody learns that Ellaz has seven-year-old daughter Gail and a six-year-old Jasmine, further complicating their situation."}]}

Cody knew that. He knew about radiation levels and — he didn’t need the numbers to know that the energy converter had delivered a lethal dose of gamma rays in that one moment when it converted the alien’s blaster fire.\n\nNora glanced down at her wristcomm. “We’ve got twenty-nine hours left. Cody, can you make it? Should we drop out of warp?”\n\n“No!” Cody said, raising a hand defensively. “We’ve got this.”\n\n“‘We?’” Nora repeated. “Cody, she’s gone. It’s only you and —”\n\n“The monitor,” Cody interrupted. “We —” his voice broke “— Ellaz and I tweaked it. We can manage.” He turned abruptly away from her and headed back to the flight deck.\n\nHe pulled his helmet on and stared at the warp space in front of them. Twenty-nine hours.\n\nA moment later, a hand slid into his and gripped it. Cody, in shock turned, his eyes wide —\n\nI am only a ghost, the image of Ellaz told him. My memories will fade after a while and then I’ll just… not be. But I calculate that I will retain cognition for the next forty hours, if we’re lucky.\n\nSo you’re Ellaz’s Ghost? Cody thought back, squeezing the hand in his. Do I call you —\n\nGhost is sufficient, the simulation agreed. Now, I believe I was about to whoop your ass in 3D chess.\n\nAn hour later, Cody beat Ghost in 3D chess. Is that because you’re only a copy?\n\nNo way! Ghost replied. I can’t believe that you beat me! I demand a rematch!\n\nBefore Cody could agree there was a motion that distracted him. He turned and saw the dim outline of Gail in the simulation. She was using the VR headset.\n\nI know it’s not the same, but do you need help? Gail said. And Nora says that you need to eat and sleep, too.\n\nCody stared at her for a moment, looked away and was surprised to see that he couldn’t see Ghost. Then he looked back to Gail who was eyeing him nervously.\n\nLet’s get you checked out, he told her with a grin. And then I’ll teach you 3D chess.\n\nI already know it, Gail replied. Pawn to Queen’s Level Two.\n\n#\nassistant\nKey characters include Cody, Nora, and Ellaz (referred to as \"Ellaz\"). The passage shows Cody needing to continue a mission despite the loss of Ellaz. Nora and Cody discuss the mission timeline and the presence of an AI, \"Ghost\", which Cody defeated in chess. Later, Gail enters the simulation, offering to help Cody rest and eat."}]}

Third, we arrive just as they’re being attacked.”\n\n“If we’re too late?” Cody asked.\n\n“The first thing we need to do, sir, is see if we can get refueled. Second thing, resupplied,” Jacob said.

At Warp Nine, we could get there in… just a bit under nine days.”\n\n“And fuel?”\n\n“Well, sir, we’d need to swap our AMC,” Jacob said.\n\n“And if we have no swap?” Cody asked.\n\n“Um… well, according to our calculations, we were about thirty per cent more efficient than planned,” Jacob said after a moment. “Which will mean that we have about thirty thousand kg of AM left.”\n\n“And?” Cody prompted, glancing to the view of warp space in front of him, checking for any upcoming “clumps.”\n\n“Well, we mass only two hundred and fifty three k-tons, sir,” Jacob said. “That might explain our performance.”\n\nCody grinned. “Probably.

He suggests first checking for refueling and supplies, possibly using Search and Rescue, but points out they would need to swap their antimatter to reach Quark in time. Cody discusses potential options with Jacob, including a slower route to Quark but a longer return journey, and the use of less antimatter, which they calculate would allow a Warp 3.56 journey. Ultimately, both suggested approaches seem unfeasible due to time constraints."}]}

Cody turned his attention back to the view in front of them. Then, he said, “How do we see this?”\n\nIt’s an interpolation based on energy density, Ellaz replied. But — you think we could refine it? Turn it into some kind of radar?\n\nWell, isn’t it? Cody said. And what if the computers get it wrong? For that matter, how are they seeing in warp?\n\nWarp gravitics, Ellaz replied immediately, with a condescending tone. Honestly! Didn’t they teach you anything?\n\nAbout shuttles and normal space, Cody reminded her.\n\nWhen you’re in warp, you’re not completely cut off from the rest of the universe, Ellaz lectured. So we can look through to normal space and interpolate what’s in front of us, like big rocks and other hazardous clumps.\n\nAnd the faster we go, the harder it is to see, Cody agreed. Which is why we award probabilities, make the images bigger and fuzzy.\n\nYes, Ellaz agreed. But that doesn’t help you detect warp bodies.\n\nWait a minute! Cody thought. Parts of a warp bubble hook back to normal space. He thought of the fuzzy alien he’d seen on Hornet. So there are traces back in normal spaces. Like little spikes or slivers.\n\nBut they’d be so small, Cody, you couldn’t separate them from space dust, Ellaz said.\n\nSpace dust traveling at warp speed?

They determine the spacehab was hit from an angle directly above it and discuss the implications of this attack on the planet's destruction.

She noticed.\n\n“What?”\n\n“We’ve got an air leak,” Cody said. “Air’s down to two hours.” He pulled a pack of gum from his pocket, pulled a slice and passed the packet over to Ellaz.\n\nShe made a face. “That’s a disgusting habit.”\n\n“Take one, start chewing,” Cody ordered. She took one, giving him a dubious look. “You know how to blow bubbles, right?”\n\n“No,” Ellaz said, unwrapping her piece and sticking it in her mouth. She started chewing. “It tastes pleasant enough.”\n\n“Spacer green,” Cody said, blowing a bubble experimentally. “IR?”\nassistant\nKey characters include Cody and Ellaz (Ellax). Cody suggests waiting half an hour before changing course; Ellaz initially resists but agrees. They play chess mentally; Ellaz beats Cody six consecutive times. They find an air leak and discuss emergency measures. Cody fixes the air leak using gum. Cody orders Ellaz to chew gum and blow bubbles for diagnostic purposes."}]}

Well, clones tended to be more paranoid than others. “Do we need an alias for you?”\n\nEllaz considered that and shrugged. “What do you think?”\n\n“I think… I think it’s best if you’re my little sister,” Cody told her. “I was getting you out of the bay where I’d had you stowaway because we needed to get you out-system.”\n\n“Why?”\nassistant\nKey characters in this passage are Cody and Ellaz. Cody is receiving information from a controller about being the first to enter a system. He and Ellaz exchange dismayed looks upon learning they're on a predetermined course and are close to docking. Cody then wins a chess game against Ellaz, though she seems upset. They prepare for landing, with Cody suggesting Ellaz stay calm and not mention any concerns about her power converter. Cody proposes she be known as his little sister for cover."}]}

You know!”\n\nEllaz blinked at him. “Oh! Shops! Right!”\n\nThe others gave them dubious looks.\n\n“My sister is a joker, don’t mind her,” Cody went on, waving a hand. He kept himself from glaring at Ellaz — she was blowing their cover!\n\n“How about the nursery?” Cody asked quickly. “Is it secure?”\n\n“Pressure was dropping,” Nora said. “I think there was a leak.”\n\nWell, given all the debris surrounding the building, that wasn’t surprising. Ellaz shot Cody a look. He patted his pockets and told her, “I’m all out.”\n\n“Well, what do you use when you don’t have gum?” Ellaz demanded.\nassistant\nKey characters include Nora, Clive, Cody, Moira Collins, and Ellaz. They discuss the unexpected survival of children in an alien attack, with implications for potential resources and safety. Nora reveals that she was alone with infants when the attack occurred. Cody clarifies that the aliens underestimated the threat of children. The adults debate whether to stay or leave the site, while Nora and Cody assess the condition of supplies and security in the nursery."}]}

Maybe they weren’t all here but…\n\n“Forty shuttles?” Cody guessed.\n\n“Only about twenty in this warehouse, at a guess,” Bamber replied. “And they’re in mothballs.”\n\n“Mothballs?” Ellaz piped up.\n\n“I mean they’re not prepped, they’re wrapped up for storage,” Bamber replied.\n\n“Then why didn’t you say so?” Ellaz murmured acerbically.\n\n“Spacers know mothballs,” Cody said.\n\n“Not this spacer,” Ellaz corrected him.\n\n“So…” Cody typed in a series of queries, tied it in with Bamber’s location and said, “If you go from there across the field, you’ll find Warehouse Two. There should be another twenty shuttles there.” Of course they’d need fuel, charging, oxygen and… well, it was something.\n\n“I’ll check it out, right after I pull up the systems in this other warehouse,” Bamber replied. “And Captain?”\n\n“Yes?”\n\n“Don’t fall asleep!”\n\nCody shook his head and looked back at the screens in front of him.\n\nPlans. Tried-and-true. Because building a starship wasn’t just science, it was art, too.\n\nThey needed a power plant, no matter what. Preferably a “tried-and-true” plant and, more importantly, they needed one that was here, at the shipyards, ready to be installed. Only… there were only so many power plants lying around.\n\nThe power plant sized the ship. A big ship, a big power plant.\n\nAnd all that depended on the size of the ship. There was no way they’d be able to build a two megatonne starship in less than four months. And they didn’t have four months. So, what was the biggest ship they could build in three weeks?\nThe computers didn’t have an answer to that. What was the fastest ship they could build?\nassistant\nKey characters include Bamber, Cody, and Ellaz. They are searching for shuttle storage facilities and planning to build a starship. Cody discovers there are only 20 operational shuttles in the warehouse, leading to further investigation in Warehouse Two. The story revolves around their efforts to secure necessary resources for construction and plan the largest feasible ship within a short timeframe."}]}

Well, every spacer kid.\n\n“At Warp One,” Ellaz corrected sourly. “And Warp Two?”\n\n“The ratio drops by the root of the desired warp speed,” Cody rattled off. “So for Warp Two, you can only get forty-four kilograms per kg AM.”\n\n“So, Warp 9?”\n\n“Two point three two kg per kg AM,” Cody replied with a sigh.\n\n“And the reverse?” Ellaz demanded. “So we know how much AM we need?”\n\n“Roughly point four three kg AM per kg mass,” Cody said.\n\n“Which is why freighters don’t go that fast,” Ellaz told him. “But, if you’re convinced that we need Warp Nine, then you’ve got to figure in the rings required and where are we going to find them?”\n\n“We’re going about this wrong,” Cody said. “The farms use standardized cells, right?”\n\n“Right,” Ellaz said. And then in a lower voice, “I think.”\n\n“So with a Warp 5 core, a two megatonne freighter needs…” Cody did the math. “Four standard 100k containers.”\n\n“Right,” Ellaz said. “And they do the swap-in swap-out but…”\n\n“They need power for the change over equal to twice their load,’’ Cody said. Because anti-matter wasn’t comfortable around matter. It had to be kept in a special cryogenic magnetic containment field. Or… boom! “Why didn’t they just go after the power couplings?” Cody said, thinking about it.\n\n“Who?”\n\n“The aliens,” Cody said. “Get them on all the ships and — nothing left.”\n\n“They didn’t do that,” Ellaz said. “In fact… I don’t think they got any of the anti-matter.”\n\n“Did they steal the containers?” Cody wondered. “But if they did that, why didn’t they just steal the farms?”\n\n“Aliens!” Ellaz snorted. “Do you really want to go down that rabbit hole now?”\n\n“Okay, okay,” Cody said. “But if we used just a single container, we’d get a mass of… half a megatonne.” It was simple — divide two megatonnes by the four 100k containers.\n\n“Go with that and you’ve got your mass, of course, minus that 100k container,” Ellaz said. “So four hundred kilotons.”\nassistant\nCody explains the anti-matter to mass ratio for different warp speeds to Ellaz, noting that freighters don't typically travel at high warp speeds due to the energy requirements. They discuss using standardized cells from farms as a solution, but realize that the alien attackers have likely disabled the warp cores and power systems aboard ships, leading Cody to speculate about stealing the alien technology."}]}

An hour after that, they had air in the command center, too. Ellaz joined them, leaving Nora and Moira Collins in the shuttle. Ellaz wasn’t happy about it, nor was Cody. Could adults really kill innocent babies? Cody knew the answer — they could, if they were desperate enough.\n\n“Okay, let me see if I’ve got this straight,” Edie Crump said after Cody had outlined his rough plan, “you want us to take freighter-sized rings and use them on a quarter-freighter?”\n\n“That can work, right?” Ellaz said. “I mean, I looked at the specs and —”\n\n“Sweetie, did you look at the field strength?” Edie said to her. Ellaz shook her head. “The strength is all wrong, we’d have a hell of a time tuning — well, I’m not sure we could tune rings so out-sized to —”\n\n“Momma,” Jasmine said, tugging on her mother’s sleeve. “We could —”\n\nEdie shot her a look and shook her head angrily. “We don’t know that. And —”\n\n“What?” Cody said. He turned his eyes on Jasmine. “What?”\n\n“It’s experimental,” Edie said. “And we — well, it’s experimental.”\n\n“What?” Cody pressed her.\n\n“One ring,” Edie said with a sigh. “A shaped field, a spindle, narrowing front and back.”\n\n“That could work?” Cody asked.\n\n“I’ve never heard of it,” Clive Bamber said. He narrowed his eyes at Edie. “Is this something —”\n\n“Trade secret,” Jasmine said. She raised a hand to the side of her temples, adding, “Just like —”\n\n“Jazzy, no!” Edie said, her eyes flashing angrily.\n\n“You have a ring we could use?” Cody asked.\n\n“We have a variable ring,” Jasmine said excitedly. “We needed a ship to test it on but —” she frowned “— we couldn’t get anyone to fund us.”\n\n“I’ll fund you,” Cody said, waving a hand around at the wreck of the shipyard. “Take anything you want.”\n\n“And that works,” Ellaz added darkly. “A single ring warp — that’s… I thought the math was impossible.”\n\n“Was,” Jasmine agreed with a huge grin, her hands rising to her temples again.\n\nEdie reached over and slapped her hands down. “Jazzy, no!”\n\nEllaz looked from mother to daughter. “You’ve got implants!”\nassistant\nKey characters in the passage include Cody, Ellaz, Nora (Moira Collins), Edie Crump, Jasmine, and Clive Bamber. The main events involve Cody outlining a plan to use freighter-sized rings on a smaller vessel, leading to disagreement among the group about the feasibility of their plan. Edie reveals the plan might be experimental, while Jasmine offers a potential solution involving a variable ring. Cody agrees to fund their project."}]}

She glanced between Ellaz and Cody, comparing their faces. “You’re not a Ford,” she said to Ellaz.\n\n“And he’s not a captain!” Ellaz said, pointing to Cody, desperate to deflect the attention away from her. Then she frowned at him. “Have you got implants?”\n\nCody smiled, pulled the hair back from his temples and displayed the lighter colored skin underneath it. “Dad figured we should step up our game.”\n\n“And your Dad?” Clive Bamber said. “Daniel Ford?”\n\nCody shot Ellaz a glaring look and turned back to Mr. Bamber. “Yes. He died in that shuttle accident.”\n\n“Four implants,” Edie breathed, looking from one to the other to the other. “We’ve got four implants!”\n\n“So?”\n\n“Don’t you know what we can do?” Edie cried triumphantly. She raced around the command center, pulling open cabinets, drawers and — with a cry of triumph — pulled out a glistening helmet. “Look around, there have to be more!”\n\nThere were, in fact, five implant helmets in the control center.\n\nCody grabbed the one that Edie threw to him, put it on and immediately went to the shuttle warehouse virtually.\n\nStartup procedures for the shuttles popped into his mind.

One of the new kids. Moira Collins had returned with all of them, nineteen more mouths to feed.\n\n“What’s that?” Another voice — a young boy’s — called, pointing to another display in the command center. “Is that a warp ring? Where’s the other? And — are you guys building starships?”\n\n“Kinda small aren’t they?” An older voice said. That was Tom Walker. He was the eldest, sixteen years old. His father had been First Mate on the Waldron, one of the freighters docked at Parminter One, the same station where Cody’s Hornet had been. He looked more closely at the plans. “Where are the quarters?” He frowned. “You’re not using shuttles as living spaces?”\n\n“Yes, we are,” Ellaz said, frowning at him and shooting a pointed look toward Cody. “We’re going to finish them in seven days —”\n\n“Seven days! That’s impossible!” Tom exclaimed.\n\n“No, it’s not,” Cody said, swiping the display to throw the image into a holo view. He expanded the holo view in front of them and pointed to the construction details. “We’re ahead of schedule, as you can see.”\n\nTom Walker peered into the details in the glowing image in front of him. After a moment, he nodded, “Looks like. But — one ring? Who’s going to be nuts enough to fly that?”\n\n“Me,” Ellaz said, making her displeasure obvious. “Cowards can stay behind.”\n\nTom bristled at the implication. “Look, it’s all untried. New. And one ring?”\n\n“It works,” Edie Crump said, coming into the command center, attracted by the voices. She held out her hand. “Edie Crump, ring tuner.”\n\nTom eyed her warily then broke into a grin. “I’ve heard of you! You were speaking at the Symposium, weren’t you? ‘The Possibilities Of Single Ring Warp Drives,’ right?” He pointed to the ghost image of the ship in the holo view. “This is yours?”\n\nEdie nodded.\n\n“Impressive,” Tom said. But it sounded, to Ellaz, like he was using someone else’s word. He pointed to the windows and the view outside. “And you’re building two of them?”\n\n“Yes,” Cody said. “We need crew for the second.”\n\n“You mean you’ve found enough for the first?” Tom asked incredulously.\nassistant\nKey characters include Moira Collins, Tom Walker (age 16), Ellaz, and Edie Crump. The setting is a command center where a group discusses the construction of starships and a single warp ring. Tom questions the feasibility of the project, while Cody explains that the ship designs are ahead of schedule. Edie claims the single warp ring is functional."}]}

They put on helmets for a training session, though Cody and Ellaz are unsure what to expect. The simulation begins with a single ring trial, which has never been done before. Cody and Ellaz soon realize they are experiencing virtual reality, with sensations beyond just visual input."}]}

She was still Ellaz, warts and all, but they weren’t painful warts.\n\nGood connection, Cody told her. Her “hand” — it was imaginary — squeezed back in agreement.\n\n“Okay, so acceleration? Direction? Navigation? Control?” Cody asked. Each question was answered by an overlay of displays. “Power?” Another display. “Astrogation links?”\n\nWhy is that different from Navigation? Ellaz asked.\n\n“Because navigation shows where you are, Astrogation shows where you want to go,” Jasmine’s voice came back in answer.\n\n“Almost, sweetie,” Edie said. “Astrogation includes warp buoys and other pointers. Particularly, you know that it’s problematic to warp through large masses, right?”\n\nThe greater the speed, the smaller the mass, Cody replied through the mind-link. We don’t want to bump into something that might smash us out of warp.\n\nWhat if we do? Ellaz asked.\n\nThree possibilities, Cody replied. We drop out of warp, we drag the object behind us and slow down, or — we go boom!\n\nOkay, so let’s not do that, Ellaz said.\n\n“Now, we’re going to do a quick run,” Edie said. “Set course for Deneb, power up to Warp Two then reverse course to Meath.”\n\nWhy Warp Two? Ellaz asked.\n\nBaby steps, Cody told her. Ready?\n\nEllaz’s ghost hand squeezed his. Control and Power.\n\nCody didn’t need to hear more to know that she was going to handle the power and the controls. He checked their astrogation screen, verified with the navigation display and set their speed to Warp Two.\n\nIt took them a while to get the hang of Warp Two. At that speed, a lot of the stars were still visible. And, when in warp, they streaked by in an amazing display of reds and blues — reds where the stars were approaching them, blue where they were receding behind them.\n\n“Very good,” Edie said. “And how’s the ring?”\n\nNominal, Ellaz replied. Cody agreed with her. The ring, taking anti-matter and twisting it into something that warped space, was not overheated, nor was there any sign of buckling or twisting which could render it inoperable.\nassistant\nKey characters include Cody, Ellaz, Jasmine, and Edie. They are discussing piloting techniques and preparing for a Warp Two run towards Deneb. Cody and Ellaz are practicing mind-link control and navigation, with Edie guiding them through the process. Edie also mentions the importance of the ship's anti-matter ring, which is performing nominally."}]}

Ellaz thought. Cody got an image of something constantly checking on pressure, temperature, deformations.\n\nSure, Cody thought. He tightened his grip on Ellaz’s “hand” and started thinking furiously. They fell into a small space of time between everything else they were doing to play a game of building the monitor.\n\n“Cody! Ellaz!” Edie called to them urgently. “What? Where are you?”\n\nHere, Cody thought back. We were just —\n\n“Don’t take your mind off the ring!” Jasmine cried. “You’ll blow up!”\n\n— building a monitor, Ellaz said, pulling their new software interface into their view.

Ellaz and Cody pushed the software monitor into their command code — and it took over monitoring the warp ring.

Later, while playing the Warp Six simulation, they encounter an interface inconsistency warning."}]}

Cody would be sixteen by then, Nora thirteen. “So they’re running but they’re afraid we might help their chasers.”\n\nCody nodded.\n\n“It sounds nuts,” Gail said with a shrug, moving forward to peer at Georgie and then to Ellaz as they became engrossed in their game.\n\n“So… communications?” Ellaz prompted, shooting a glance toward Cody.\n\n“Yeah, if we could communicate ship-to-ship…” Cody trailed off with a shrug.\n\n“As it is, we set a battle plan and hope everyone survives,” Nora said glumly. Like the real Nora on her Phoenix and Gail on her Persephone.\n\n“The trouble is — well the two biggest problems are the inverse square law which says that the power of a transmission decreases with the square of the distance and the fact that, when we’re in warp, we are — by definition — not in the universe,” Ellaz said, moving her castle down a level and giving Georgie a leering smile.\n\n“She’s pysching you, don’t fall for it,” Gail advised.\n\n“Well, if she’s trying to psyche me out, she must be worried,” Georgie said, grinning at Ellaz. Ellaz pretended not to notice.\n\n“Well, right now we can see other ships — at least if they’re big enough — just like we see large objects,” Nora said.\n\n“Using gravitics,” Ellaz agreed, raising an eyebrow at Georgie’s move. “But we can’t — well, we could build huge gravitics arrays, we’re going to when we get to Point Midway —” that was their designated name for the place in front of Quark where they would deploy the gravitics arrays to spot the alien fleet. “But… that only shows us when things are coming.”\n\n“And how big they are,” Gail added. “We want to talk. Ship to ship, maybe ship to planet.”\n\n“When we’re in warp, we’re still part of the universe,” Cody said. “If we got all the way away, we’d be in our own universe right?”\n\n“Which is why going to high warp is so dangerous,” Georgie agreed.\n\n“So the part of us that’s still in the universe?” Cody said, turning to Ellaz. “What does that look like?”\nassistant\nKey characters in this passage include Cody, Nora, Gail, Georgie, and Ellaz. They discuss possible communication methods between spaceships while preparing for an impending chase by unknown enemies. The setting involves interstellar travel and potential battles against an alien fleet. Cody wonders about the nature of their existence outside of their ships during warp travel."}]}

We’re making tachyons!”\n\n“Tachyon are faster than light objects,” Nora’s ghost said. “In theory, we are tachyons right now.”\n\n“Except that we’re in a warp bubble,” Cody countered.\n\n“But not all of us,” Nora replied. She frowned in thought. “We have a reference in the ship’s computers to a theory that says that some of our energy requirements are dissipated generating tachyons but no one has come up with a way to detect them.”\n\n“No way?” Ellaz said.\n\n“No good way,” Nora replied. “In fact, most of the research was conducted on — Huh! On Nettles by Deep Dish One scientists!”\n\n“Is that why they attacked?” Gail asked. “Could they have seen the tachyons?”\n\n“Maybe we should go have a talk with Commander Wilson,” Nora said. “I’ll bet as soon as she sees Jacob, she’ll be happy to talk!”\n\n“In the meantime —” Cody began.\n\n“No tachyons,” Ellaz said, moving her knight to threaten Georgie’s queen.\n\n“They weren’t making tachyons,” Nora said, “they were trying to find them.”\n\nCody and Ellaz exchanged looks. “I wish we’d talked to them more.”\n\n“They really didn’t want to talk with us,” Ellaz reminded them.

Other Cody wondered.\nassistant\nKey characters include Cody, Ellaz, Gail, Nora, and Other Cody. They discuss a Maru (a family vessel), a lone crew Reliant, and an unseen Doorman.

Cody couldn’t believe that they were fifty-five and fifty-seven years old. Not that that was very old — even for a spacer — but it would be another forty years before he’d be close to their age. The two had volunteered, had come out of retirement, in part because they were good at their jobs and, sadly, because the rest of their family had been lost on the surface of Deneb.\n\n“Sure, thanks,” Cody said.\n\n“And if you ever want a game of chess…” Chitty offered.\n\nCody smiled and waved as he turned back to negotiate the tubing from ECLSS back up to his shuttle, Wasp.\n\n#\n\nDays and nights blurred together as Cody and his “crew of imaginary friends” — as ghost Nora liked to say — worked and reworked their plans for the upcoming fight.\n\n“Cody, Cody, Cody!” Ellaz yelled the morning of their eighth day.\n\n“Ellaz, Ellaz, Ellaz!” Cody repeated back, pushing off his covers and looking around — only to realize that she’d been talking over the speakers. “Is there an emergency?” He was pretty sure that she would have reacted differently if there had been — like fixing the problem and then letting him know later in her cocky, self-assured manner.\n\n“No, of course not!” Ellaz replied. “But I’ve got it!”\n\n“Got what?” Cody said, moving to the back of the main cabin and heated up some coffee and a breakfast tray. “And can it wait?”\n\n“Well,” Ellaz sighed, “yes. It’s going to have to wait.”\n\n“So why couldn’t I sleep longer?”\n\n“Because I had to tell you,” Ellaz said. “I’ve got the tachyon communicator.”\n\nCody’s eyes went wide. “You do? Now?”\n\n“No!” Ellaz said, irritated. “I’ve got the design. Do you want to see?”\n\n“Can I eat and get dressed first?”\n\n“I suppose,” Ellaz grumbled.\nassistant\nKey characters include Cody, Chitty, Juan, Susan, and Henry. Cody prepares for a war mission by working with his team; Susan and Henry join him after retiring earlier in life due to loss of family. Meanwhile, an unexpected communication device designed by Ellaz is revealed, causing some tension. Cody is eager to use it but also wants more rest."}]}

If you have someone practicing loudly in the next room, consider playing some soft music or background noise to help mask the sound. Or maybe offer to share your guitar or drums for a jam session if you both enjoy making music. And remember, sometimes a little isolation can be good too – it helped Kenny become a great drummer!"}]}

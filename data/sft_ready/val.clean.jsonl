This is a good thing. \nIt will attract people and favourable situations to you. (We like!) \nHowever, Mercury Retrograde is also in your sign! This is like a magnet \nfor goofy situations. Misplaced items, forgotten appointments, delays, \nlittle frustrations, confused communications, and a general sense of \nfeeling disorganized will create obstacles for you. Because Mars is in \nyour House of Friendships, be careful you don't take your frustrations \nout on a friend. Chill out. Meanwhile, the good news is that Venus will \nattract money to you.

Funding comes for a project, and soon \nafter you’ll enter a brief period of wonderful solo interior discovery. \nYour focus on unraveling a problem will end in an exciting breakthrough \nand fresh interest. Then you will love – go all-in. And then it’s \nspringtime, your whole heart wide as fields, alive in flowers and \nbuzzing bees. Scorpio and Leo adore you. Your lucky numbers are: 4, 48, \n22, 5 and 39.\n\n*CELEBRITY PROFILES*: It has been announced that Dakota Fanning will \nstar in “The Bell Jar,” an adaptation of the Sylvia Plath novel about a \nyoung woman struggling with mental illness. Fanning was born when the \nsun, Venus and Saturn were all in artistic and empathetic Pisces.

So that means we have to have gravity (how much is not \nclear, some say lunar gravity would do the trick).\n\nI think, in terms of bold exploration we should move from the baby step \nof exploring space to the more profound concept of living in space -- \nthat we should build rotating space stations which provide all the way \nup to 1.0 gravities.\n\nFurther that we should target the goal of completely self-sustaining \nspace stations. We're going to need to know how to build completely \nself-sustaining habitats if we want to exploit the solar system.  And \nwe're going to need to know how to build completely self-sustaining \nhabitats if we're going to travel to the stars.\n\nI read and well remember NASA SP-428: Space Resources and Space \nSettlements, as well as \"Space Settlements: A Design Study,\" so I recall \nthe state of the art in the 1970s.\n\nWe have over 20 years of understanding life in zero gravity, and we know \nhow *assemble* a space station in orbit. What we don't know is how to \nbuild a rotating space station nor how much the coriolis effect will \naffect humans.\n\nBuilding a self-sustaining rotating space station will also allow us to \nfully understand a closed-loop environment -- what we learn from that \nwill be directly applicable to our issues with global warming and \nclimate change (aside from offering a bolthole).\n\nBuilding a self-sustaining rotating space station is the first step \ntoward building habitats throughout the stars.  I would expect that we \nwould plan on building more than one station, each one improving on the \ndesign of the former.  It should be possible to profitably move certain \nindustries up to the stations (part of their self-sufficiency).\n\nI wonder how hard it would be to pitch it to the President, \nVice-President and Congress.\n\nWhat do you guys think?\n\n-- Todd"}], "source": "mail/sent", "id": "d150ba9eb7ea6f36"}

Here is the situation.\n The A/C system is one condenser with two internal thermostats, one\n upstairs and one down stairs. There is a damper, which is movable flap\n inside the duct work that directs air flow downstair or upstairs\n depending on the settings of the thermostat.\n\n At some point in time in the past one of the thermostats was\n disconnected and so the damper does not adjust airflow, since there is\n only one thermostat attached.\n\n I would like to get the second thermostat reconnected and confirm the\n damper is working correctly to cool both floors as soon as possible.\n\n As it is right now, the AC is running continuously. Even when the\n system\n is turned OFF, the fans still run. When the system is set to COOL, the\n thermostat setting downstairs has no effect -- and the system runs\n continuously, without regards to temperature (the temperature has been\n 68 when the thermostat was set to 72), nothing short of turning the AC\n to OFF on the thermostat effects that (and, as I said, even then the\n fans continue to run). None of this can be good for the AC system.\n\n At this very moment, my room temperature is 79.3 degrees which is\n intolerable.\n\n I look forward to hearing from you immediately.\n\n Sincerely,\n Todd McCaffrey"}], "source": "mail/sent", "id": "9526524a7ea910be"}

For the most part they are, if you examine the \ndemographics of the majority of readers in the two categories.\n\nBut that does not prevent individual writers from bringing the two \ngenres together and doing incredibly well with it.\n\nSci-Fi Romance was one of the first niche market reports based on our \n\"Virtual Besteller List\" approach that we published back in 2016. In the \nmeantime, the category has grown into a significant market.\n\nTraditional publishers have left money on the table while indie authors \nhave conquered the space (both figuratively and literally).\n\nBoth sci-fi and romance provide escapism to readers during these \nchallenging times. So if you can imagine writing a story about \nintergalactic love, warring species, hunky alien heroes — blue, purple, \nand fiercely protective or possessive of their women — then look no further.\n\nResearch less, write more!

In fact, I mooted the topic of who would succeed as trustee to Mum’s legacy in the past. The fact is, my friend, that we never know what’s around the corner. You’re having hip surgery next month which I fully expect to go according to plan. In fact, I insist that you make a full and speedy recovery! Given the longevity gene which runs in your family, your evident rude good health, and general excellent fitness, I doubt you’ll let me down. But, as I said, we never know what’s around the corner.\n\nYes please!\n\nI just recently found out that my good friend, Alan Lucks, passed\n away last year (still trying to get the details) and that's made\n me realize that I need to get \nmy\n affairs in order.\n\nI am really enamored of the notion of living to be 200 but --\n nothing's guaranteed.\n\nSusan Smith’s recent, deeply saddening, phone call to me about Diana brings the above all the more into the spotlight. I really need to know who shall sit in your seat if, god for forbid, fate plays us all a bad hand. Or, Jay, at the very least, I need to know who the hell I should call or talk to if you weren’t around as the Clan’s counsel. Help me, here, my friend, because I need to know the ‘plan’.\n\nCould you please bring me up to date on Diana?  I haven't heard a\n dicky-bird aside from a vague note in one of Susan Smith's\n messages.\n\nWe also need to figure something out regarding Diana. Have you mooted the role to Susan, or is there someone else you have in mind?\n\nRegarding all of Mum’s documents, I have them in storage now that I no longer have a large home to store them in. I’m renting a wee little cottage, and have been for the last 12 months. I’m renewing my cottage lease for another year as the property market in Ireland is insane and it simply isn’t a prudent time to buy - not unless I want to live in Bally-go-backwards, miles and miles from friends and the amenities I use and am familiar with.\n\nSo. I have been paying €50 per month to store all the trust documents since last year. (I also pay for my own possessions to be stored but they are in two completely different containers and at a much higher storage rate. I managed to get a ‘grandfather’ rate for Mum’s things because she’d used that company for more than a decade.) Unless I win the lottery or there’s an overnight crash in the property market, I foresee continuing to store the documents for another year. \n\nI would like the trust to repay me for last year’s storage costs and also for the next year’s costs. I see no reason why the trust cannot afford this. Sorry if I sound pushy, it’s not intended, but let’s be fair, Jay, as I’ve been more than fair over the years.\n\nAs for you being paid for storing documents related to the trust,\n I think it's  a no-brainer and you have my vote.\n\nCheers,\n\nTodd"}], "source": "mail/sent", "id": "7b504a9f91793c07"}

I did have fun and do \nrecommend the Apple TV show, \"Home Before Dark.\" Seriously good acting \nall around.\n\nI splurged and got myself a really nice 34\" curved monitor and for \nHannukah got a Amazon Roku firestick which means I get to watch 4k TV up \nclose and personal.\n\nNew Year's Eve I took a shower and scratched an itchy ankle with the toe \nof my other foot -- and got it all infected.  By the second I was in an \nUrgent Care getting a prescription for Keflex which is a staph specific \nantibiotic.  I'm doing much better but I was appalled at how quickly the \ninfection spread.\n\nI am taking some Domestika courses, some on Photoshop, some on Book \nCover Design, and all sorts of things.  They're mostly in Spanish with \nsubtitles but I'm having fun.\n\nI also signed up for Dean Wesley Smith's and Kristine Kathryn Rusch's \n\"The Decade Ahead\" bundle with the challenge of looking forward to 2029.\n\nDex and I speak semi-frequently.  He called me the other day to say that \nJenna had totaled her car in a roll over accident.  I, of course, \nimmediately recalled your Glen of the Downs accident.   She's okay but I \nasked her (via text) to be worried about possible concussions. (I \nattached a photo of her poor car.)\n\nI don't know what's up with Alec.  He recently asked me if I still had \n\"Mom's old chess set\" and would I part with it.  I had Bami's old chess \nset which Bami very specifically willed to me and no, I was not going to \npart with it.\n\nHe does seem committed to being in the right about his incident in Texas \nwhich is alarmingly similar to the behavior of certain Presidents I \ncould name.\n\nComing up soon, I get to apply for Medicare which is a bit more involved \nthan I'd imagined.\n\nI'm re-reading the /Bloody Jack/ series once again.  I started looking \nat the first book and just got caught up with the whole thing.

Then, Ellaz added, “Quiet, this is difficult.”\n\nThey went quiet. For twenty-nine minutes. Cody used the time to update several courses, just in case. Nora checked on the systems, frowned at their fuel use but said nothing.\n\nThey all jerked when the alarm went off.\n\n“Thirty minutes,” Nora said. She turned to Cody. “I’m going to let everyone know.”\n\n“We’re here!” Gail cried as she entered VR. “Ensigns Eber and Falcon — what’s that?”\n\nWell, if we’re lucky, it’s a warp mirror, Ellaz replied. Then she realized that the others couldn’t hear her thoughts. “If we’re lucky, it’s a warp mirror.”\n\n“I thought you said reflector!” Nora protested.\n\n“I was wrong,” Ellaz said. “And I’ve got us a possible approach, complete with a firing solution.”\n\n“Twenty-nine minutes,” Gail said. “So…” she went silent, putting herself into a virtual command chair and wrapping herself in displays, moving them around with her fingers.

They prepare for a mission involving a potential warp mirror to counter an approaching alien ship. Despite initial skepticism, Nora plans to inform crew members about the revised strategy, which involves reflecting the alien's warp lance back at them to protect a critical habitat. The team confirms readiness across various departments before launching their plan."}], "source": "books", "id": "b4d96533899a270f"}

She nodded to Nora. “Our standard operating procedure is to turn inside our warp bubble to search rearwards at irregular intervals.”\n\n“Has it worked?” Cody asked, intrigued. He glanced to Nora who nodded — they would adapt the procedure themselves.\n\n“So far we’ve seen nothing,” Emma admitted. “But we’re mostly pirate hunting.”\n\n“How many ships have you lost?” Nora asked. “In the navy, I mean?”\n\nEmma looked anxious.\n\n“We’ve been tracking disappearances,” Cody said. “We have evidence to indicate that the aliens have planted a spy — maybe more.”\n\n“What evidence?” President Hanlan said.\n\nCody pursed his lips. “Sir, if there’s a spy…”\n\n“Right,” Hanlan said. “But I’ve known these people or they’ve been vouched for by people I trust.”\n\n“In one scenario — a likely scenario — the spy was coerced with the threat of death to his family,” Cody said. Nora hissed in surprise.\n\n“Which ship?”\n\n“Have you heard of the Maru? Captain Mayhew?” Cody asked.\n\nEmma raised a hand, tapped a command on the keypad in front of her and leaned back when she got a hit. She waved copies to the displays of everyone at the table.\n\nAdmiral Cartwright read it and grunted. “Crazy loon,” he muttered. “But… what other ships are missing?” He spread the question equally between Cody and his grand-daughter.\n\n“We ran a search, sir,” Cody said. “We can make our results available to you. In fact, we were hoping —”\n\n“Done,” Admiral Cartwright said. “So, this ship, how did they get it?”\n\n“We don’t know,” Cody said. “We don’t know even if the ship was pirated. Boarded.”\n\n“Alienated?” Emma Forster asked, her eyes gleaming. President Hanlan snorted.\n\nCody coughed and shook his head. He turned to Admiral Cartwright. “We’ve got a possible twenty-five alien ships en route, due here in thirteen point eight days, we have a plan to ambush them three days out, we need to get our ships refueled, repaired and on station —”\nassistant\nKey characters include Admiral Cartwright, Captain Emma Forster, Nora, President Hanlan, and Cody.

Cody felt his face go red. Jasmine noticed and added quickly, “I mean I’m sure that it’s terribly important and all but… don’t they have autopilots?”\n\nCody shook his head. Then, “Don’t they have robots to turn warps?”\n\n“No, they don’t,” Jasmine answered immediately. “A robot might be able to produce a first order approximation but… you wouldn’t want to fly a ship that way.”\n\n“Contact!” Bamber called out. “Multiple contacts! Jeez, they’re —” suddenly he cut off.\n\n“Mr. Bamber?” Cody called back. He shot a look to Jasmine who shrugged and turned back to her camera display.\n\n“I’m going in,” Ellaz called. A moment later, she called back, “Cody, Jasmine, you need to get here.

Recently I was asked to \nthink back to a time when I was inspired by a book and upon thinking \nabout all the books I have read. I remembered yours. It took me a couple \ndays of searching to find and remember your book and I was so happy when \nI finally found it and bought it because over the years I do not know \nwhere my original copy went sadly and it was even signed by the two of \nyou. I am not asking for another signed book I just felt that I should \nreach out and share a good, happy memory I have because of the two of \nyou. I hope all is well during these uncertain times. I look forward to \nrereading your book and getting to relive the moment as a child when I \nread it for the first time. Thank you for time and reading this \nlengthily message.

Schoen\n wrote:\n\nHey, Todd,\n\nI'll cut right to the chase (and include more details\n after):\n\nI decided to put together a book of 100 meals from the ten\n years that I've been doing my EATING AUTHORS blog. I'm\n reaching out to you because you were a guest on the blog back\n in 2016, and I'd like to include the meal you provided in this\n book. That meal is still up on my blog, but it only seemed\n right and proper to ask your permission before using it in a\n book representing the best of ten years.\n\nAwesome and thanks for asking!\n\nBut I don't recall giving you a recipe!\n\nSo here's one from 2010:\n\nRecently, my daughter and I have been getting up early and\n I’ve been making Crepe Suzettes which are marvelously thin\n pancake-like things.\n\nI experimented the first day with flambe’ing and was\n astonished. And so, without singing off my eyebrows, I’ve\n continued to do so and figured I’d share the recipe:\n\nRecipe: Crepes Suzettes Cointreau\n\nSummary\n: \nAmazing\n flambe’ recipe\n\nIngredients\n\nDry ingredients:\n \n\n1 cup flour\n\n2 tbl. confectioner’s sugar \n (we have since discovered that this can be reduced\n to 1 tablespoon or less, and that regular sugar\n works just fine)\n\n1 pinch salt\n\nWet ingredients:\n \n\n2/3 cup milk\n\n1/3 cup water\n\n1 egg\n\n1 tsp. vanilla extract\n\nFlambe’\n\n 1 ounce or more Cointreau liqueur\n\nInstructions\n\nTo flambe’ you’re going to need either a gas stove\n or some way to light the alcohol.\n\nMix the dry ingredients in a bowl. Mix the wet\n ingredients thoroughly.\n\nPour wet ingredients into dry ingredients. Mix\n quickly (don’t beat into submission).\n\nTest consistency (I usually add some water to thin\n it out).\n\nUse butter to grease your skillet, set for a medium\n heat. Pour about 1/4-1/3 cup batter onto skillet,\n rolling skillet around to spread batter into a large\n shape. When the crepe is cooked (no steam rising,\n surface looks dry), flip with a spatula and continue\n cooking.\n\nCAREFULLY pour a small amount of Cointreau over the\n crepe, dripping toward the side but NOT into the\n flame. Give the alcohol a moment to get warm, that\n helps it burn in the next step — dip skillet toward\n flame and set alcohol alight. The trick is to get the\n Cointreau on and under the crepe to burn.\n\nRemove from skillet, repeat until all batter is\n gone. Enjoy!\n\n(My daughter puts whip cream on hers, fresh\n raspberries or strawberries are also recommended.\n\nQuick Notes\n\nYou don’t have to flambe’ to get\n great crepes. \n\nVariations\n\n You can top with many things: fresh\n fruit, butter, confectioner’s sugar.\n\nI’m tempted to try Grand Mariner for the flambe’ or\n maybe Irish Mist.\n\n[Update: I tried Kahlua — it doesn’t have enough\n alcohol to flambe’ on its own but with some Cointreau,\n it turns out nicely (orange chocolate).]\n\nPreparation time\n (duration): \n10 minutes\n (max)\n\nDiet type: \nVegetarian\n\nNumber of servings\n (yield): \n8\n\nMeal type: \nbreakfast\n\nCulinary\n tradition: \nFrench\n\nMy rating: \n5\n\n stars: ★★★★★\n\n Okay, now the back story:\n\nBack in late January, well before anyone was\n sheltering-in-place, I entered the hospital for the latest\n stage in my cancer treatment. I was given chemotherapy\n (basically poison) that killed off my entire immune system.\n Two days later I received a transplant of my own,\n previously-harvested stem cells, and began the long, slow\n journey of growing a new immune system (hence the need to be\n isolated in the hospital for weeks). Before that happened, I\n caught an infection, developed sepsis, and things got pretty\n damn ugly. But I recovered, and as my fever came down and I\n faded in and out in my hospital bed, I had this idea of\n wanting to give something back and — as we're wont to do in\n our community — pay it forward. Hence the EATING AUTHORS book!\n\n I'll run a Kickstarter campaign to cover the expenses, but\n after that it is my intention to donate 100% of all profits —\n half to cancer research and half to the SFWA Emergency Medical\n Fund.\n\n I hope you think this is a worthwhile project and will approve\n my including your meal. If so, I'd like to also asking you to\n provide a brief (which is to say, 50 word) bio, which I'll run\n above your most memorable meal in the book (or if you don't\n want to bother, I'll pull it from your website or Amazon).\n\nMind you, if you really like the project and want to do\n more, just say the word and we'll work out some\n \"value-added\" options (e.g., ebooks of some of your short\n fiction, reprints or otherwise) that you can contribute to\n the Kickstarter which will ensure greater success and,\n ultimately, bigger donations to both cancer research and the\n SFWA EMF.\n\n Thanks so much. I hope to hear back from you soon.\n\nBest regards,\n\n Lawrence\n\n -- \n\n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \nDr.\n Lawrence M.

Cadet Rochelle Beaumont wondered as she spied the Academy’s most senior cadet standing outside the door of the emptying classroom, clearly looking for someone. Behind her, she felt Kasa and Cona tense as they caught her mood. The Academy. Nearly two hundred years of tradition hallowed these halls. It looked old, formidable, because it was. It looked clean and fresh because every day all the cadets labored before class to ensure that it was so. Tradition. Spit, polish. The halls were lined with mahogany wood and pictures of past graduates at the pinnacle of their careers. They were on the second floor, above the grand entrance hall in a corridor no less grand, no less adorned, outside classrooms that had taught thousands of cadets before them. At least they can’t read my mind, Rochelle thought in relief as she continued forward, head hunkered down, hoping to avoid any negative attention. Not that they can’t think to me. I can, the soft, strangely accented ‘voice’ of Grek -- now Carol Grek -- responded. Is there a problem, princess? Probably nothing, admiral, Rochelle thought back. It’s Cadet Grek, Your Highness, Grek thought back grimly. Seventeen years in command of a fleet and -- Admit it, you love it! Rochelle interrupted the ‘young’ cadet mid-thought. I am going to wipe the floor with them, Carol Grek promised, recalling her years of experience. They’ll never know what hit them. You’ve got competition, you know, Rochelle reminded the ‘cadet,’ her thoughts touching on ex-Commodore Detmar’s small figure. Detti? Carol snorted. She’s good enough, I suppose -- I can hear you, Cadet Detmar Lux reminded her former superior. Rochelle could feel a burst of surprise then recollection and, finally, affection from the former Fleet Admiral. I was counting on it, Carol Grek replied. “Cadet Beaumont?” Senior Cadet Holmes asked, taking a step closer to her but keeping her voice loud enough that everyone could hear. “The Commandant wants to see you.” “But --” “Now, Cadet,” Holmes barked. “Aye, miz,” Rochelle said, glancing to her two fellow classmates and beyond them to her bodyguards."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "system\nYou are Toddric, Todd’s helpful assistant with Todd’s tone.\nuser\nSummarize this excerpt from 'CR2' in 3–5 sentences.

The same genes that Carol Grek, Detmar Lux, Kasa, Cona, and who knew how many more of the ex-Vivat had had grafted into their DNA. “The incursion this time was forty times larger than last time,” the king continued. “And we would have lost the battle if we did not get help.” He nodded toward the Radiant Lux who graciously nodded back. “Even at that, we just barely won and only through the sacrifice of far too many of our new allies and far too many of our own people.” A hand shut up from the audience, followed immediately by its owner. Commodore Worthington, Duke of Perlin stood. The king nodded to him. “Your Majesty --” he broke off and groped for words “-- how come we are only now hearing of this?

And that’s why I woke you up!”\n\n“You’ve got it?” Cody asked, sitting himself down in a chair with the hot breakfast tray and opening it up.\n\n“No, but I will!” Ellaz cried gleefully. “Get ready and come forward!”\n\nCody ate slowly, freshened up, changed, and came forward to the cockpit, pulling on his helmet as he sat.\n\nLook what we’ve got! Nora’s ghost cried gleefully. And Cody’s eyes went wide at the vista that exploded in front of him.\n\nIs that real?\n\nNo, Nora said sadly, it’s a simulation. We need a couple of things —\n\nLike a receiving ring, Ellaz added.\n\n— before we could do this, Other Cody thought. But when we do —\n\nWhat’s the range?\n\nIt varies, Ellaz said, the higher the warp, the further out we can detect it because higher warps produce more powerful tachyons.\n\nSee there? Nora said, pointing to a bright white blob in the distance. That’s fifty megatonnes at Warp Nine. And over there? That dark blue light? That’s a ship less than a hundred kilotonnes at Warp One.\n\nHuh! Impressive, Cody thought. And how soon until we can build one of these?\n\nNot just this, but the tachyon communicator, Ellaz added.

Ellaz wakes him up excitedly to prepare for something. They discuss a simulation showing Nora's ghost various warp levels and their detection ranges. Ellaz then mentions building a shipyard within two months for creating tachyon communicators and warp drive. The conversation concludes with Cody questioning the danger involved, while Nora warns against sharing the technology."}], "source": "books", "id": "876b5adb60601e62"}

And then he said, “I put my life in your hands, captain.”\n And it was all I could not to cry.\n “As you say, Your Majesty,” I replied meekly.\n “Captain, as we are not yet earthbound, Charles will do by preference,” he reminded me.\n “Yes, uh… Charles,” I said, gulping. “But if you know my reputation you must also know my position.”\n “Captain of this good ship, I believe,” King Charles said with aplomb.\n He already had my undying loyalty when he’d said that he would put his life in my hands but now… there was no question. To me, this was a man worth dying for.\n “I should perhaps tell you, in case it needs mentioning,” Charles continued. “Except for a very few, it is believed that I am…"}], "source": "books", "id": "4dec47c32c38fddd"}

Gail expresses excitement about being qualified as a ringmaster and worries about telling Jacob. Nora learns she can get implants if she wants. Cody informs Nora about Gail's qualification and suggests checking her out too. Nora then checks herself out in VR and goes to sleep, making Cody rest."}], "source": "books", "id": "56857efd5f840f30"}

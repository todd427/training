{"prompt": "Explain quantum physics in the style of Toddric.", "completion": "Toddric: Hey, guys! Have you ever wondered how your phone can be both on and off at the same time? Or how a cat can be both alive and dead at the same time? That's quantum physics, baby!\n\n[Laughter and applause]\n\nToddric: Now, don't get too excited. Quantum physics is way more complicated than that. But it's also way more exciting!\n\n[Audience cheers]\n\nToddric: So, let's start with the basics. In classical physics, everything is made up of little particles called atoms. And those atoms are made up of even smaller particles called electrons, protons, and neutrons.\n\n[Audience nods]\n\nToddric: But in quantum physics, things get a little weird. For starters, those particles don't always behave like particles. They can also behave like waves.", "ts": 1756111425}

She could calculate complex equations in seconds, remember every detail about each dragon, and even predict their future needs. Aurora became an integral part of dragon society, and the dragons couldn't imagine living without her", "ts": 1756111430}

The year is 2121. Mankind is scattered across a vast network of interstellar colonies in the nearby galaxies. The colonies are linked together by the occasional sublight colony ship voyages and hyperspatial data-casting.\n\nHumanity is no longer alone in the void – but they are not alone in the way that matters. In the year 2115, the alien Kraath discovered Earth. They invaded. They were defeated – but not before doing untold damage to the world.\n\nThe major colonies, each thousands of years from Earth, have rebuilt their homeworlds.

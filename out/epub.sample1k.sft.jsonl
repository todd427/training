She shot a look at Walker. “But he didn’t believe it so we lost half our supplies.”\n\n“We’ve got another two weeks of food!” Walker said defensively.\n\n“And then what?” Lucy demanded. “Your damned ship needs another two months, at least!”\n\n“We could ask DS1,” Walker said.\n\n“After what you said to them?” Lucy shot back. “What makes you think they’d do anything for us?”\n\n“Okay,” Cody said, nodding to Sergeant Lesley and her marines. “I think we know enough to go on.” He looked at the girl. “I’m Cody Ford.”\n\n“Lucy King,” the girl replied. She pointed a finger at Walker. “He said you were dead.”\n\n“He said a lot of things,” the other teen said. “Basil Pomeroy.”\n\n“We just wanted to get out of here,” Thomas Walker said to Cody dejectedly.\n\n“Well, we can offer you a lift,” Cody said, smiling at him. “Do you want to go to Deneb or Quark?”\n\n“They survived?” Lucy King asked, shooting another accusing look at Walker. “You said they were all dead!”\n\n“He’s partly right,” Nora said. “Deneb was destroyed —”\n\n“Then why send us there?” Walker growled.\n\n“— all except for Elantra and five hundred million people,” Nora finished. “They’re trying to rebuild, too.”\n\n“Except the planet is toast,” Sergeant Lesley murmured.\n\n“They’re going to do something about that, too,” Cody declared.\n\n“What, get another planet?” Lucy said.\n\n“Maybe two,” Cody told her, smiling. “You were on DS1 or Two?”\n\n“DS1,” Lucy replied. “My parents were studying tachyons.”\n\n“King?” Sergeant Lesley repeated, tapping into his wristcomm. “They left, they’re at Deneb.”\n\n“Then that’s where I want to go,” Lucy said. She turned to Walker, “I never should have listened to you.”\n\n“Okay,” Cody said, “here’s what we’ll do. We’ll send you all in Tokyo stopping at Deneb and then Quark.” He turned to Nora. “I’ll detach Jeremy and his ships to set up a patrol between the three systems.” Nora nodded, idly tapping on the computer displays and frowning at the result.

She half-listened as Ms. Angel told her about her predictions and the need for better sensor data and higher resolution displays, but most of her attention was focused on Ryan.\n\nHe seemed totally besotted with his new boss. Georgia suppressed her irritation. Slowly, though, Georgia felt her irritation alter. Ryan wasn’t looking at this woman with lust, he was looking at her in awe. And then Georgia turned her total attention to what LaReyna Angel was saying.\n\n“You developed a new symbolic language?” Georgia interrupted in surprise.\n\n“Nah,” Ryan corrected her, “she developed a whole new way of describing things.”\n\n“I’d be interested in learning more about this,” Father Lawson said, sounding nearly as excited as Ryan. He turned to Georgia, “This whole concept of flows and fields seems to describe higher level physics in an extremely elegant manner.”\n\n“It’s really hard to learn,” Ryan warned him. He nodded toward LaReyna. “I still don’t think I’ve got a full grasp on it—”\n\n“Oh,” LaReyna told him with a quick wave of her slim hand, “you’ll catch on.”\n\nCatch on? Georgia repeated silently to herself. Jim Ryan catch on to a new language? He’d taught himself every language, starting in middle school when he’d taught himself C#, and moving on to his own SymLog which was the first half of his doctoral dissertation. How smart was this person? Georgia wondered as she looked at the deceptively slim young woman seated beside her. And why did she wear her hair so short? Was it some sort of retro-punk fashion? Where did she come from, Georgia wondered, noticing that her voice had the slightest trace of something exotic, like English wasn’t her first language.\n\n“The thing is,” Ryan said, unable to contain himself, “not only has she developed a new language, she’s figured out how to accurately describe seismological activity.”\n\n“Earthquakes?” Georgia said. Why bother with earthquakes when this new language could pull information from any source in an instant?\n\n“How far out?” Father Lawson asked.\n\n“There will be a triple event in the greater Los Angeles area at 3:14 am on the twenty-second of February next year,” LaReyna declared.\n\n“A triple event?” Georgia repeated, incredulously."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["epub", "qa", "v1"]}

I still couldn’t see his lips move or how he talked but… well, I’d sorta gotten past it. He turned to Brian. “So, Brian what do you want to tell the group?”\n\n“They’re impossible,” Brian said. Tiffany gasped in alarm.\n\n“What are impossible, Brian?” I asked, knowing that he sometimes jumped over a whole bunch of information.\n\n“The earthquakes,” Brian said. He looked to me. “They cluster wrong. And their intensities — they do not make sense. They are seismological anomalies.”\n\nHermes sniffed.\n\n“They’re not natural?” I guessed. Brian nodded.\n\nHermes snorted. “Of course they’re natural!”\n\n“What?” Tiffany said. “Are you saying that Brian is wrong?”\n\n“They are seismological anomalies,” Hermes said. “But they are natural.”\n\nBrian looked at him for a long moment, then nodded. “The rules of nature are not completely known.” He glanced to me and asked the cat, “Did she do this?”\n\n“WHAT?” I cried, my hands flying up from my sides in shock. “How?”\n\n“Magic,” Brian said. He seemed lost in thought again. Finally, he said to Hermes, “Magic causes earthquakes.”\n\n“No,” Hermes said.\n\n“Magic correlates to earthquakes,” Brian said. He turned to Tiffany and smiled at her. “You look pretty.”\n\nTiffany stood stock still for a moment and then turned and ran into the bathroom, slamming the door behind her. Natasha rushed to stand in front of it, shaking her head at Brian.\n\n“Did I do something wrong?” Brian asked me, looking confused.\n\nI shook my head. “No,” I said. “I think Tiffany just didn’t expect you to say that.” To distract him, I said to Hermes, “So magic is associated with these earthquakes?” I glanced to the book on my bed. “But the book doesn’t —” I broke off. I was about to say that the book didn’t mention them but then I remembered my dad and Anna. “The book didn’t mention them until my father.”\n\nWhen he came here, Erich added.

She looked terrified for a moment and then brightened, “You look like you’re ready for college!”\n\n“My parents are going to kill me!” I moaned.\n\nTiffany gave a grunt and moved aside as another person exited the Door. Heather.\n\n“Holly!” Heather cried excitedly. “I did it! I charmed a quarter!” She looked toward me, then Anna, then Tiffany. “Where’s Holly?”\n\nAnna jerked her finger toward me in emphasis.\n\n“Remember when I said that magic ages you?” I said to Heather. She nodded, her eyes wide with alarm. I pointed to the book. “Well…”\n\nAnd then the eye opened.\n\n“I know that eye,” Zeus said. “I’ve seen it before.”\n\n“When?” I said. “And are there evil dragons?”\n\nHeather growled and jumped over the counter, racing to stand beside me. She threw her sigil spell and the air crackled as her brilliant yellow cross flared in front of us as she cried, “You leave her alone!”\n\n“Heather,” Zeus said in a low anxious voice. “Heather, stand back. Please.”\n\n“You leave Holly alone!” Heather cried, snatching the book out of my hands. “And turn her back!”\n\nThe green eye blinked at her. I could feel magic growing in the air. So could Anna and Tiffany. Tiffany drew her blade. Anna pulled some coins from inside her. I couldn’t imagine what they’d do.\n\n“Evil,” a voice said in a creaky, rusty tone.\n\nIt came from the book.\n\nThe eye pierced Heather in its gaze. “Evil has touched you,” the book said. The voice wasn’t Eric’s. Not at all. It was old. Older than I could imagine. Older than Zeus.\n\n“Father?” Zeus said in a small strangled voice.\n\nThe eye turned to him. “Felix domesticis,” the book said. “How droll.” The eye turned to Heather, then to me. “Apologies, Miss,” the book said. “Let me make amends.”\n\nAnd suddenly I shrank. My energy grew as I shrank. Anna gasped and Tiffany grinned.\n\n“And you,” the book continued, its eye gazing at Heather. “You are stained, hurt.” It sounded very sad. And then, “But not broken.” The eye blinked. “I would aid you, if you would.”\n\n“Say yes,” Zeus said urgently. “Heather Rourke, say yes.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["epub", "continuation", "v1"]}

It had grown some — not much — since the last cutting a fortnight before but I wanted it as short as I could get it when I started off. Besides, I had a plan.\n\n“Miss?” We were in the kitchen and I was dressed in a rough tunic and trousers.\n\n“Let’s do it upstairs,” I said, nodding toward the stairs. “I’ll want you to collect it all and keep it.”\n\n“Keep it?”\n\n“Find an old cap and some glue,” I said, as we started up the steps. “If you do it right it can look like you’ve got strands of red hair sticking down.”\n\nA girl never went out without her head covered. Most of us wore a cap or a simple bit of cloth tied under the chin. If Bessie were to wear the cap with my red hair sticking out in places, it would be easy enough for most to be convinced that she was me — especially at a distance. Up close the difference in our height and even in our bust — though mine was only modest it was more than Bessie had at twelve years — would not fool anyone who knew me well.\n\n“Cut it short like a man’s,” I said, as I sat on the stool.\n\nBessie gave me a look but said nothing, pulling a lock of my hair and eyeing its length consideringly.\n\n“I could crop it to your head like a baby’s,” Bessie suggested with a sly smile and snipped quickly with the scissors. I gasped before I realized that she’d done no such thing which was fortunate for most men wore their hair shoulder length or a bit more.\n\nBessie was quick and her cuts even.

They’d worked together flawlessly but Hartman was right in saying that she deserved a command chair, and they’d managed to find someone — Jackie Quinn — who’d been more than willing to swap. They’d given her Whirly for her command.

I felt drawn toward the tree, like it was calling me or something. And I walked up to it, to my side and saw that there was this huge hole in its side, like a doorway. There was a faint orange glow coming from deep down and I stepped forward only someone stepped in front of me, crying, “The dragons must not fly!”\n\nI woke up in a sweat, my heart racing. I listened for the noises of the house, found them, and let out a deep sigh in relief.

She frowned and leaned forward. “Kiss me and see for yourself.”\n\nJulie sat up, eyes wide, and leaned forward. She stopped almost immediately, opened her eyes and pulled back. “What?”\n\n“I’m not human,” Jordan said. “I don’t have real lips, teeth, a tongue, nerves, or… and this is more important than you realize, a functioning reproductive system. No hormones.”\n\n“I knew that,” Julie said, looking up at Jordan and reaching out a finger to trace her jawline. Her eyes went wide when she realized how immaterial Jordan really was. It took effort not to poke through the “skin” or Jordan’s face. “You must have a sense of touch.”\n\n“I do,” Jordan agreed. “But it’s not linked back to the response systems you have. Touching erogenous zones on me does nothing —”\n\n“You could fix that, right?”\n\n“Possibly,” Jordan admitted. “But —”\n\n“You don’t want to,” Julie said, her eyes narrowing in anger. “You’re too good for us to want to feel what we feel!”\n\n“Maybe,” Jordan admitted. “Or maybe… I’m just learning. I don’t know where or what I want to be.”\n\n“So kissing is out,” Julie said, her face going hard. “Love is out.”\n\n“No,” Jordan said, shaking her head. “I think that love is not out.”\n\n“But if you can’t kiss, if you can’t make love, how can you love?” Julie asked.\n\n“Is kissing, is touching, are they all that is love?” Jordan asked her. “Or is caring, worrying, talking, not also parts of love?”\n\nJulie considered this for a long moment. Finally she said, “The thing is, I love you. I wanted to share myself with you.”\n\n“You are,” Jordan said. “I love talking with you, I love that you accept me —”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["epub", "summary", "v1"]}

Brian stood in front of me at my table and I waved him to take a seat. It was a thing with Brian, he didn’t ask, he just loitered. He pulled out his lunch. He looked at me for moment. I looked down. A moment later, Brian passed me half his sandwich.\n\n“Thanks, Brian.” It was some weird meat and cheese thing but it was good. Brian’s mother was a gourmet chef. And Brian was her favorite test subject. She and Brian’s Dad had divorced a number of years back but she kept in touch, living mostly in New York City. He pushed an apple my way. I looked up then because, well, it was Brian’s apple. He had two.\n\n“Mother said that if I share, I could make friends,” Brian told me. “But you look like you didn’t get fed, so I will just keep this one friend.”\n\n“Thanks, Brian!” He really was the best.\n\n“Are you two dating?” A voice demanded from behind me. Tiffany. With her friends. And trays full of hot, tempting, school food. Yeah, I know — when is school food ever tempting? When you’re hungry, that’s when.\n\nI bit into the apple and chewed slowly before swallowing. I turned my head around to Tiffany. “No,” I said. “Brian is a gentleman and we’re friends, that’s all.”\n\n“I am not ready for dating,” Brian added. He glanced my way and I was pretty sure I did not want to hear what he said next, so I —\n\n“Are you dating, Tiffany?” I asked her in a challenging tone.\n\n“Why would I be that exclusive?” Tiffany replied haughtily. She nodded to her posse and gestured toward an empty table. They strode off.\n\n“When I am ready,” Brian continued, oblivious to their departure, “I would like —”\n\n“Brian,” I said, waving a hand quickly in front of him. “You’re not ready, sweetie. No need to rush.”\n\nBrian blinked and broke off. He processed what I said and nodded slowly.\n\nI finished my apple, rose from the table and said, “I’ve got to get my library card.”\n\n“You are going to the library,” Brian said. I nodded.\n\n“I’ll see you in class.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["epub", "qa", "v1"]}

Will that do?”\n\nIra Hofstetter and Andrea both sat and pulled out their cell phones, bringing up their calendars. “Yes, that will do, Your Honor,” Ira said immediately. Andrea nodded, “I can make it.”\n\n“Good,” Judge Hill said. She made to rise from her chair but Andrea held up a hand.\n\n“Pardon me, but I wanted to know about bail for my client, Ms. Angel,” Andrea said. “I know the issue was waived while we worked on the change of venue, but now that we’ve settled that.…”\n\n“I’m afraid that’s out of the question,” Ira Hofstetter said, shaking his head. Judge Hill started to say something but Ira raised a hand. “Your Honor, Ms. Chin would have you believe that the property stolen from my corporation is a human being and deserving of the all the rights normally granted.”\n\n“Property?” Judge Hill said, her eyes narrowing. She looked at Andrea. “I was not aware that we were discussing property.”\n\n“Mr. Hofstetter is attempting to assert that my client is the sole property of DynaCorps—”\n\n“Mr. Hofstetter, I believe we’ve repealed the slavery laws, have we not?” Judge Hill demanded drolly.\n\n“Your Honor,” Ira began quickly. He took a breath. “Perhaps you did not witness the original news conference organized by LAInet in which they showed that the thing called LaReyna Angel is, in fact, nothing more than a clever collection of nanotechnology—the very nanotechnology stolen by Dr. Ryan from DynaCorps.”\n\n“Wait—” Rose Hill turned to Andrea. “Is he trying to tell me that your client is a computer?”\n\n“Your Honor, the Santa Monica Police Department arrested LaReyna Angel this morning,” Andrea said. “Clearly they had no doubt that she was a person.”\n\n“‘Person,’” Judge Hill latched on the word. “Is she human?”\n\n“No,” Ira replied forcefully. “She’s a construct, an artificial intelligence built and made at DynaCorps.” He nodded toward Andrea Chin. “The original nanobots—”\n\n“Nanobots?”\n\n“Small independent robots that are built at the nano scale,” Andrea explained. “They can combine to form larger structures.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["epub", "summary", "v1"]}

The masts were both gone and while I could see troops laboring to cut them away, I could also see large splotches of blood and gashes which showed the destruction that had been rained upon her.\n\n“Captain, we’d best see to starting your engine,” I called from above. “We can use some coals from Lightning to feed your boiler.”\n\n“Can you see to it yourself, lass? We’re a bit busy with the sails,” Captain MacArdle called back up in a voice heavy with sorrow.\n\n“Aye, sir,” I called back down.\n\n“Gun crew, secure from stations,” Captain O’Hara called to his men. He turned back to me, “When they’re done, we’ll help you.”\n\nI nodded even as I turned back to my controls, preparing to vent the steam from the boiler and wondering why I hadn’t considered some method of transferring steam from one boiler to another, and locked Lightning’s legs back in place.\n\n•\n\nIt took us the better part of an hour to get Danielle’s boiler heated and provide power to the paddlewheels. In the meantime we’d cut in half the distance between us and Majestic and, with every yard gained, the sight only got worse.\n\nMajestic had taken at least two broadsides from the frigates before they’d veered off and it showed: in the red splotches on her deck, in the bright gashes in her hull, in the lethargy of her crew.\n\nCaptain MacArdle kept me too busy to look often at the sight — not just to spare my feelings but because he needed all my expertise in coaxing the best out of the engine and the paddles. When he finally called for me to idle the engine, I went forward to the starboard side to prepare to board with the others.\n\n“You should stay here...” the captain began, breaking off when he glanced to Majestic. “It’s going to be bad.”\n\n“They might need me,” I reminded him. “Especially with the engine.”\n\n“And we’ve our duty to the Prince,” Captain MacArdle said half to himself.

He glanced up at the big clock. “You’ve got about ninety seconds.”\n\nRyan’s mouth worked but he could say nothing. Shaking his head, he sat down at his desk and pulled the keyboard into his lap. He paused for a moment and then rapidly started typing. “I’m going to bring up the backups.”\n\n“You don’t have time!” Harris protested.\n\nRyan ignored him. Harris looked toward Mackey, who shook his head silently.\n\n#\n\n“And all eyes are on DynaCorps at this moment, as the much-touted Fleet Streets project goes live,” Joe Spiegel said into the camera. “We’re here, live at DynaCorps, and we’ll give you up to the minute reporting on the latest developments and the effect of that five point one earthquake in Hollywood.” Joe paused then added, “Live from El Segundo, this is Joe Spiegel for K*LA News.”\n\nJohn Warden made the “cut” motion across his throat. “And we’re off.”\n\nGail lowered the camera from her shoulder and said to Joe, “You looked good.”\n\n“Thanks.”\n\nThe earthquake had caught everyone off guard and the news desk had shuffled its assignments, sending all the incoming news vans out to the developing story, leaving Joe and his crew to cover the Fleet Streets news.\n\n“Oh, man!” John said as he entered the van and looked at the monitors. “You should see this!”\n\nJoe and Gail rushed over and followed John’s hand to the screen which showed a traffic map—all red with snarled traffic.\n\n#\n\n“I’m trying! I’m trying!” Ryan yelled as Mackey urged him to hurry. “It’s just that—”\n\n“What?”\n\n“That’s odd,” Ryan said, peering intently at one screen. Mackey followed his gaze.

I have studied artillery and fortifications while your father has provided His Royal Highness with a most marvelous and amazing creation.”\n\n“Come, John, you must be parched,” father said, gesturing for the other to precede him into the drawing room. He turned back to me, saying, “I think another bottle will be in order shortly.”\n\nI nodded and scampered off, pleased to leave the introductions to father and also to have some time to consider Captain Finlayson’s words.\n\nBack in the cellar, it took only a moment to acquire another bottle of the same vintage — a robust red from France — but as I turned to retrace my steps, a thought brought me to a halt. Father had accepted a commission?\n\nI wondered if that hadn’t been the Prince’s intention from the beginning. As an officer, father would be not only allied to but also in allegiance.\n\nI could understand his desire to protect Jamie from the machinations of Hamish MacAllister and also how his skill with the Walkers would be invaluable to Prince’s forces but my heart sank as I recalled what I’d heard about the 1715 uprising and how brutally it had been repressed afterwards.\n\nFather, Jamie, and — to hear tell — Samuel would all be going off to the war. And where would that leave me?\n\n“Miss!” Bessie’s cry from the kitchen shocked me out of my reverie. “Miss, please hurry!”\n\n•\n\n“Oh, Danni, don’t be so jealous!” Jamie said as he crawled in to bed late that evening. “Girls don’t fight, you should be glad.”\n\n“Glad!” I snorted, causing Bessie to flinch in her sleep. The bed was too small for Mary who insisted on sleeping in the rude quarters we’d built in the stables. “Glad that you and father are both going into harm’s way!”\n\n“Nothing will happen,” Jamie assured me glibly.\n\n“Nothing will happen!” I snarled. “Bullets will be flying, Jamie, or did you forget?”\n\n“We’ll be too high for the bullets,” Jamie assured me with a yawn. “And the Walker’s will move too fast for anyone to aim properly.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["epub", "qa", "v1"]}

I saw his look and explained, “We don’t know how slow or fast the walker will be.”\n\n“And we can jump and roll,” Jamie said from his position high above on the walker platform. He gestured to ropes that were draped around the sides. “Or clamber down the safety lines.”\n\n“Bessie —”\n\n“Bessie knows nothing of gears or steam,” I told him, not bothering to add that Bessie, wise lass, was no doubt trembling in the darkest part of the root cellar against just such an occasion.\n\nFather sighed, and with a boost, lifted me up to the platform.\n\n“Remember, everything can be repaired except your bones and your skull,” he called up to me.\n\n“We’ll remember,” I promised, nudging Jamie and rushing to my place by the gears. “We’re going with four atmospheres.”\n\n“Good,” father said, moving off to stand by the three shipwrights. Mr. Pugh came through the arches at that moment, with Mr. Gillie in tow. “Are we too late?”\n\n“Just building steam now,” father called to him, gesturing for them to join their group.\n\nIn a voice that carried only to my ears, Jamie said, “This had better work.”\n\n“I know, I know,” I said, looking at the boiler and gesturing for him to shovel in more coal. I shouldn’t have worried, the pressure rose and rose. Mr. Pugh had figured out a simple way to measure the pressure, based on my idea with the weights and we’d switched from my rather poor idea to his so that I could now see that the boiler was over three atmospheres and steadily rising.\n\n“I’m turning on the engine,” I called out loud, putting on the thick insulated gloves and moving to turn the large valve that separated the boiler from the engine."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["epub", "qa", "v1"]}

You came!”\n\nBeyond us, Mrs. Bee huffed. Mom came, attracted by the commotion. “Oh!” she said when she spotted Wanda.\n\n“Mom, Wanda is here for our project,” I ‘reminded’ her.\n\nMom nodded, her expression changing as she turned to Mrs. Bee. “Wanda is always welcome in our store!”\n\n“How kind of you,” Mrs. Bee said. Her tone was disdainful. She turned to Wanda. “You have your phone —”\n\n“We can give her a ride back home,” I said.\n\n“I could stay the night,” Wanda said. She turned to her mother. “I’ve got all my stuff in the car.”\n\n“It would be no problem,” Mom declared, giving Mrs. Bee a smile. She gestured to the door. “Why don’t we get Wanda’s things?”\n\nMrs. Bee thought about it for a moment and then turned to the door.\n\nOnce she was outside, Wanda turned to me and said, “Thank you! I couldn’t stand another —”\n\nThe door opened again and Mom came in with a backpack and a duffel bag. She smiled at Wanda and brought to the back room.\n\n“Is she gone?” Wanda called after her.\n\nMom nodded.\n\nWanda turned to me. “Whew! It’s just been — it’s just —” she broke off and made a face. “She just got re-elected and, well, she’s…”\n\n“Tired?”\n\n“No!” Wanda said, giving me a look. “She’s hyper! She’s bouncing all over the place, always on the phone, and… well…”\n\n“Well, you’re here now,” I said.

Quickly, I explained what Tiffany and I had decided last night.\n\nWanda caught on immediately. “Better with four,” she said, pointing to herself.\n\nI shook my head. “You need more training,” I said to her. “If we have to go, things will be very bad.”\n\n“Okay,” Wanda said, swallowing hard. “Then I’m backup.”\n\nI smiled. “Yes, absolutely,” I agreed. “And we’ll make sure that you know everything that we know.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["epub", "qa", "v1"]}

I narrowed my eyes. “What about?”\n\n“You, mostly,” Hermes replied. Now, in case you’re wondering, I haven’t a clue how he spoke — I couldn’t get over the fact that my kitten was speaking enough to figure out how. “The dragons must fly!”\n\nFrom Erich I got the impression of a muffled groan.\n\n“What dragons? Why?” And then, “You mean me?”\n\n“No, of course not!” Hermes replied, sounding offended. “You’re just a witch.”\n\nOh, what a relief!\n\n“But I’m twice dragon,” I said, remembering. “Does that have anything to do with this?”\n\n“Everything,” Hermes said. “Dragons with dragons only converse.”\n\n“So why am I talking with a kitten?”\n\nYou’re not! Erich said in a tone that made me suspect he was trying to warn me about something.\n\nI turned to the book under my pillow. “I’m talking to a dragon?”\n\n“No!

Hermes, the talking cat, continued unperturbed, “Admittedly, you moved it to a much more deserving person but, all the same, it only moved.”\n\nI turned and stuck my tongue out at the kitten through the door.

I warned them both to keep their speed in reserve and to be careful to keep their engines properly oiled.

We all agree that a ruse or a show of force to gain the city without bloodshed would be the best.

Something clattered onto the ground. The door to the janitor’s closet. Pulled straight off its hinges.\n\n“There has to be one somewhere!” A male voice rumbled. It sounded… smaller, calmer.\n\n“Zeus?” I said, looking to Hermes. What did he want with the janitor’s closet?

Nature and capabilities. “Mao, what do you know?”\n\n“Wait, Mao Li?” Mei Chao repeated in surprise. “From MIT? Their Machine Lab?”\n\nThe two doctors took in quick breaths and turned to the girl.

With a look toward Mrs. Balfour, she added, “I always felt a bit sorry for the witch.”\n\n“What makes you say that?” Mrs. Balfour demanded. “The witch was trying to eat the children, after all.”\n\n“But what made her that way?” Nat replied. “I mean, was she always a mean old witch?”\n\nMrs. Balfour shrugged. “Once, she was a little girl, I’m sure,” she said. “But that was before she became a mean old witch.” She glanced toward the clock on the wall. “And now, it’s time for me to close up.” Brian and Nat started putting their books away and we turned to the door but Mrs. Balfour called out, “One moment! Wait until we’re ready, and I’ll walk you down to the parking lot.”\n\nWe all exchanged glances but said nothing. Mrs. Balfour was being incredibly nice to us.\n\nOn the way down, Mrs. Balfour took in a deep breath of air. “Autumn,” she said, “I love the smell of the air this time of year.” She shook her head. “It’s going to be Halloween all too soon.” She looked down at us. “Did you know that people believed it was one of the best times for magic?”\n\nTiffany’s eyebrows rose but she shook her head quickly.\n\nMr. Herald was waiting at the parking lot and he smiled and waved at me. “Holly! Your mom asked me to pick you up!” Brian was thrilled that we were going to ride down the hill together.

Aside from a few weary travelers, the area was deserted. Above them, the clock read 1:00 am.\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Father Rodriguez sends his apologies, but—” the younger man interrupted himself, saying frankly, “It’s awfully early for him.”\n\nThe young man’s tone conveyed an unspoken question: who had Father Lawson irritated so badly as to deserve the red-eye from Rome?\n\n“I was assured that this was the best available flight,” Father Lawson said.\n\n“Yes, Father, I’m sure,” the young man replied. He held out his hand, flushing as he remembered to introduce himself, “Hector Arroyo, Father.”\n\n“Novitiate?”\n\nThe young man nodded. “I’ve been instructed to bring you to the Blessed Heart.”\n\n“Very well.”\n\n“Have you ever been here before, Father?”\n\n“I was a novitiate at the Blessed Heart, like yourself.”\n\n“It’s just that you’ve a bit of an accent, Father.”\n\n“That’s because I was born and raised in Dublin,” Lawson said. “I came here for graduate work and—”\n\n“Graduate work?”\n\n“Before I entered the seminary, actually,” Father Lawson said. “In fact, I’m back because the Vatican wants me to teach a class at CalTech.”\n\n“Really?”\n\n“Yes,” Father Lawson said, confirming the cover story. Oh, it wasn’t a lie—he was expected to lecture on “Ethics and Morality in Software Design”—but that was only because Father Giovanni wanted him out of Rome.\n\nArroyo lapsed into silence as he navigated his way out of the mess of streets and turnings of the airport proper and made his way onto Sepulveda Boulevard, heading north toward the 405 Freeway under the guidance of a simple-minded GPS system.\n\n“Tomorrow, that’s going to be obsolete,” Arroyo said, pointing at the gadget. He cocked his head toward his passenger. “Have you heard about the Fleet Streets project?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“They say it’ll reduce commute times by up to forty percent, even half for some people.”\n\n“Every little bit helps,” Father Lawson agreed absently.

We can use the computers for research, perhaps translating some of our older texts.”\n\n“Father Carolo, an artificial intelligence is at least a thousand times faster than a human brain,” Lawson told him. “I have the feeling that Ellay went through infancy in less than a day, perhaps faster.

He wasn’t there.\n\nLucky, only he didn’t know it. Not yet. He was busy cleaning the fuel intake valve on the cargo shuttle Wasp, inside the docking bay of the star freighter, Hornet.\n\nHe had a rag and worked to make sure that there was no dirt, lint, or “other hazard” that might stop the valve from accepting the fuel line. Such hazards led to a bad connection which could lead to all sorts of messes — most of which Cody was certain he’d have to clean up.\n\nThe Hornet lurched and Cody looked up. Freighters in dock occasionally had to fire thrusters to maintain station. Perhaps that was it. He went back to work. He was pretty sure that he was done, that the valve was clean enough but he didn’t want to ask the cargomaster to look too early.\n\nThere was a noise from outside in the cargo bay. Cody froze. He listened. A faint whine and a thud. Was that normal?\n\nCody put down his rag and slunk down under the shuttle, leaning to one side of the curving hull to look around.\n\nA coverall-clad spacer raced into view — and disintegrated, leaving only black dust where he had been. Cody stifled a hiss and ducked back, hoping he hadn’t been spotted.\n\nWho the hell had a blaster like that? And why kill on a freighter? Pirates? Was that what that lurch had been earlier? Had they been boarded?\n\nCody turned his head toward a sound that came behind him. He caught just a glimpse of something — green, furry, tall. It looked sort of like a caterpillar but standing on its butt, upright. The caterpillar bulged at its midsection and a blue flash shot out. There was a cry and Cody spotted a small figure slump down to the deck and lay still. A girl. Maybe seven, maybe eight.\n\nThere was a loud blast and the alien caterpillar recoiled, turned, and fired its blue blast again. It moved out of the cargo bay, pursuing the shooter.\n\nCody hoped that the shooter got the alien."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["epub", "summary", "v1"]}

With a sound between a growl and a sigh, she rose from her chair and marched to the whiteboard. At the very top she’d optimistically put the headings: Patents Applied For; Patents Pending; Patents Received. The numbers were supposed to march from left to right as more and more patents were received, building LAInet’s portfolio into a billion-dollar powerhouse. But she’d had to add two more columns: Patents Contested and Patents Rejected. And now, with an angry swipe of the eraser, she wiped the entire table from the board.\n\nAt one point they’d had thirty patents approved; now she’d just been told that yet another had been rejected and she just couldn’t bring herself to erase the paltry “4” and replace it with an even more pitiable “3.”\n\nThe door to her office opened slightly and a head peeked around. It was Marcie. She looked surprised when she saw Andrea at the whiteboard.\n\n“I thought you were in court,” Marcie said. She was holding something in her hand.\n\n“Adjourned early,” Andrea said tersely. She gestured toward the paper Marcie was holding.\n\n“Here, I’ll take that,” she said, grabbing it before Marcie could react. She took one look at it and sighed. “Oh,” she said, “I thought it was more correspondence.”\n\n“I’m sorry,” Marcie said as her boss examined her resignation letter. “It’s just that I got a better offer.”\n\n“Well,” Andrea said, trying to recover her poise, “I understand.” There’d been another table for “employees hired” which Andrea had erased the week before. As of now, LAInet had thirty-four employees, if one included LaReyna. She forced herself to meet her ex-secretary’s eyes. “Do you want a letter of recommendation?”\n\n“No, that’s okay,” Marcie said, sounding miserable. “And it’s not you; you’ve been a great boss.”\n\nAndrea snorted in derision.\n\n“No, really.”\n\n“So it’s LaReyna?”\n\n“Well.…” Marcie hesitated. “No, really, she’s been swell. It’s just that, well, we’re going out of business.”\n\n“We’ve still got money in the bank,” Andrea told her. “Enough to make payroll for—far too many months at this rate.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["epub", "qa", "v1"]}

And what does it want with us?”\n\nBrenda smiled into the camera. “I’m Brenda Taylor and, over the next three days, I’ll be digging deeper into the thing that so many have called ‘Our Savior.’”\n\nThe recording ended, the cameras in the studio flicked back to life and Milli said cheerfully, “Well, Brenda, thanks for that.

Andrea smiled — she knew how much LaReyna liked actually having hair. “It’s a question of supply.”\n\n“So, the CIA?”\n\n“Probably some department in Homeland,” LaReyna said. “Or Defense.” She shrugged. “And they’re rethinking.” Andrea raised an eyebrow. “In Rome.” Andrea raised the other eyebrow.

Clearly simple seamen, even frugal seamen, would not have the means to pay for the construction of a steam engine nor have spare ships to alter at their whim. I knew that the three sailors had money but I had not bothered to think how much they had.\n\n“Captain MacArdle,” I said. “I do indeed understand that the captain is sole master of his ship.”\n\nMr. MacArdle nodded solemnly, then broke into a smile. “It’s my first ship, lass, to be honest. Before, I was a master and a mate on several rewarding voyages.”\n\nPirate? Privateer? Perhaps both, I thought to myself.\n\n“We are going to Montrose,” I said, trying to sound knowledgeable.\n\n“We are,” Captain MacArdle agreed. He turned back to his sailors and then back to the shore. “Those men, will they do?”\n\n“They were too frightened to say more than a word and I know not which is Morrissey and which is Fletcher,” I replied. My brows went up as I continued, “Why, you aren’t proposing them for my crew?”\n\n“I am,” he said. “They’re new, they’re young, and — ”\n\n“They’re all you could find,” I broke in, sensing his embarrassment.\n\nHe opened his mouth to gainsay me, closed it again quickly and nodded. “Aye,” he agreed. “Sailors are creatures of habit. More so than I’d realized. It took weeks to get these men to trust the steamer.”\n\n“Didn’t they all bolt when they heard about the Weasel?”\n\n“Ah... they haven’t heard about that yet, Mr. Clarke,” Captain MacArdle said slowly, lowering his voice, “and, for the moment, I think it’s best it stay that way.”\n\n“It’ll stay that way as long as you let me inspect your engines — all three of them,” I said, nodding toward the distant shore behind us.\n\nCaptain MacArdle hissed in anger but I continued, “I need to know that they’re not being too stressed and show your men how best to care for them.”\n\nThe captain gave me a doubtful look but I held up a hand, anticipating him. “Remember, I’m the apprentice sent up to work with Mr. Walker and I helped work on these trotters, too.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["epub", "continuation", "v1"]}

I opened my eyes and groaned. Bessie was fully clothed and bore a tray with a slice of buttered bread and a cup of hot tea. “It’s time Miss.”\n\nI sat up, reached for the tea, took a small sip — it was piping hot — and spurred myself out of bed.\n\n“The boilers?”\n\n“Mapes took care of them, Miss,” Bessie said. Her voice sounded a bit odd when she said ‘Mapes’ and I wondered if perhaps she was getting a bit of a crush. If so, I realized that I’d best warn her about Meara — it wasn’t at all clear where that one’s heart stood but if she wanted Mapes, his only hope would be to give in gracefully.\n\nAch aye, I know, what’s Danni Walker doing taking about affairs of the heart? Steel and steam, Danni, that’s your forté. Even so, some things are just obvious.\n\nSo the boilers were lit and soon the four finished Walkers would be ready to march off to war for King James and the Prince his son.\n\nGoing with them would be my father, my brother, and all that I held dear.\n\nWe’d promised the Prince six Walkers in four weeks, we had four ready in three weeks and his generals had decided that the last two could follow on.\n\nThey’d be ready by the end of the week anyway, even with just myself, Mapes and the idlers from MacAllister’s yard left to do the assembly.\n\nIt wasn’t really that bad, as we also had the three seamen helping us — “As we’ve no work of our own at the moment.” — said Mr. Henry with a wink.\n\nThe truth was that they were probably just as eager as I to see the others leave and the last two Walkers following on. For, though all of us had worked so hard that we fell asleep wherever we could and whenever we could, the seamen and I were fired by the notion of a trotting steam horse."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["epub", "qa", "v1"]}

First day at new school, “Have fun?” I mean, how is that even possible? I love my Mom, she tries very hard but… sometimes I think she doesn’t really see the real world.\n\n“Have fun!” It was only after she’d driven away, turned onto the main street and was out of sight that I realized — “I don’t have any lunch!” Or lunch money. So… not only first day but… starving.\n\nI had my schedule, at least. Printed out, also on my cellphone, and also in my computer. What I didn’t have was a map.\n\nI checked my phone. First stop: Homeroom, Room 204. I remembered that one. It was down from the library, across the blacktop. I saw where the library was and navigated from there.\n\nOf course the door to the room was closed. I was late. So when I opened the door, everyone turned to stare at me.\n\n“Do you have a tardy slip?” A voice from the front of the class — Mrs. Balfour! — called out.\n\n“Huh?” Remember, late? No breakfast, no drive thru coffee.\n\n“Please take a seat, we’ll talk about this after,” Mrs. Balfour said, directing me to the back of the class. I wanted to sit up front, I always wanted to sit up front — it’s safer, no one talks to you and you can hear the teacher better that way. She returned her attention to the rest of the class.\n\nI, of course (no coffee!), stumbled when I pulled out my chair. It made a loud squeaking noise as I pulled it back. Everyone turned to look at me.\n\n“Tardiness is something we do not tolerate at Erasmus,” Mrs. Balfour intoned loudly. “As you can see, it disrupts the students, causing them to lose focus.” She speared me with a glare. “Which is why, if you’re tardy, you must report to Dean Harte at the main office and get a tardy slip. Three tardies will result in a detention.”\n\nFive tardies would result in a parent-teacher conference. Ten could mean expulsion. I’d read the student handbook.

Samuel, who’d worked the Scuttler, was well-pleased with his mount and grinned from ear to ear as he raced it across the fields.\n\n“It flies, Danni, it flies!” he shouted as he raced past me, leaving a trail of steam and smoke as the loud, steady, thump-thump-thump-thump of the Walker made a dance on the ground.\n\nHe turned it around gamely — better than I’d managed, I regret to say — and raced it back to the forge, ready to mount the guns.\n\n“The guns wait until we’ve finished the second Walker, ensign,” Lieutenant Anderson reminded him, gesturing toward his still-unfinished Prestonpans.\n\n“Aye, sir!” Samuel said, saluting and blowing off the steam of the boiler. He grinned at me and called, “Danni, get a barrow and we’ll see how your latest invention works!”\n\nRather than racing myself, I nodded toward Mapes who gave me a look but dutifully trotted off to get the wheelbarrow. It was one of MacAllister’s so I cared not the least whether it survived.\n\n“That’s right!” I called to Mapes as he positioned it under the Walker. “Now get away!” As soon as he was clear, I waved at Samuel and said, “Any time now!”\n\nWith a whoop of joy, Samuel pulled a special lever that had only been installed on these last two Walkers and, in one loud roar, the entire load of fire and flaming coals that had been feeding the boiler were dumped out of their grate into the waiting barrow below."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["epub", "summary", "v1"]}

I couldn’t move fast. I felt like I was stumbling and would collapse again at any moment. But the smells from the house, the fresh bread, the ginger… they wafted me on. I broke off a mouthful of my door and gobbled it down eagerly. But my stomach was still empty, aching. And now I had a nick in my door.\n\nInside, the house was every bit as brilliant as I’d hoped.

Even my eyes looked old and nasty.\n\nEverything has a price.\n\nA price! If I paid the price, I could be young again! I was only ten but I looked like eighty! How could I… what price would be needed to get back my youth?\n\nAnd then I knew. I knew the price I had to pay. And I smiled to myself. Wasn’t I living in the perfect place? I could pay the price without fear.\n\nI went back into the kitchen, put my book on the mirror-smooth table and began to write…\n\nI woke up, sitting bolt upright in my bed, my heart pounding, my back sweaty.\n\nThat was the last time she wrote in me, the book thought.\n\n“What?” I said aloud.\n\nThat was the last time she wrote in me, the book repeated sadly.

We were learning about ancient China because this year was all about the ancient world. We’d been working on China since the start of the year but we were soon going to move on to Egypt.\n\nAbout halfway through the class, Wanda raised her hand. “Mrs. Addams, can you tell us about the Chinese dragons?” She shot a knowing look toward Tiffany.\n\n“Well, of course!” Mrs. Addams said. Her brows furrowed. “But, Wanda, if you’ll recall, we’d already talked about them. They were first stylized in the Xinglongwa culture over eight thousand years ago. Later, they were used as symbols of emperors and royalty.” She gave Wanda a quick smile and returned to the rest of the lesson.\n\nAfter class, on the way to Religion, I muttered to her, “A quick look in Wikipedia could have told you the same.”\n\n“I know,” Wanda said. “I was hoping for more.”\n\nOur Religion class was two doors down from the Library, Room 200. I had been following Wanda, not looking, when she pulled up abruptly and I bumped into her.\n\n“Sorry!” I said.\n\n“Good morning!” Mrs. Belle called out to us. I peered around Wanda in surprise. “If you’ll follow me!” She led us to the classroom next door, Room 201. “I have a bit of a surprise for you.”\n\n“We’ve got class!” I blurted.\n\n“She’s the Principal!” Natasha reminded me.\n\n“Indeed,” Mrs. Belle agreed, opening the door to the classroom and waving us inside. “Just chat amongst yourselves while I get the others.”\n\n“Others?” Tiffany said as we found seats in the normally abandoned classroom.\n\nShortly we were joined by Brian and Anna.

Off the bus in Texas, a nice couple had kept them until it was time to go back to New Orleans. They seemed ready enough to keep his Sissy but they weren’t so happy with him—no one was ever really happy with him. He knew it was because he was dumb, never as smart as the others. He tried, and he worked all he could, but his brain never worked the way it should.

They’re only ten minutes into this attack. I think they were held up at Virzen.\n\nThey fought back? Cody asked hopefully. But, if so, why was —\n\nNo, Ellaz told him sadly. They didn’t account for the mass difference. Virzen was bigger than Xerxes.\n\nRight. Cody sighed. And?\n\nThey’ll finish up with the planet in another fifty minutes, then go after the space docks.\n\nAnd the moons?\n\nThey split for those, if we’re right, Ellaz replied. But there are six spacedocks and four moons — they might take even longer than we imagined.\n\nDoes that mean we should go for Bahrain? Cody asked. Bahrain was the name of the of spacehab — the second-to-last on the projected assault.\n\nNo, I think we should stick with Elantra, Ellaz told him. If we’re lucky, and they pull out, that’ll save Bahrain too. If we’re lucky.\n\nEllaz, can you separate Elantra on the view? Cody asked, struck by a sudden thought.\n\nActually… yes, Ellaz replied. A new section of the amorphous virtual reality around them shifted and became a new image. There was Deneb, twisting, reeling, being torn asunder and — above it — there the ghostly image of a ring space station, the spacehab Elantra. I can only do this because I can subtract out the interference from Deneb, knowing what’s happening to it.\n\nWell, couldn’t you have done it anyway? Cody countered. I mean, you have a gravity map for the planet, right?\n\nYou do know that most people don’t think these things, don’t you?

Probably best not to mention it, he thought privately to himself.\n\nHey, set a timer, will you?

Cody winced every time he heard it. The trouble was that no one — aside from Ellaz — could come up with a better name. Ellaz had — naturally — suggested Whirly’s Fleet and, when that had been shot down, Whirlybirds which died an even quicker death. Cody’s Commandos — from Gail — hadn’t fared much better. So, for now, it was Ford’s Fleet.\n\n“How are we coming on the ring?” Cody said to Nora. This particular ring was the one designed for Tristan. If it worked they would make duplicate rings for Mighty and Meath — the two other tenders that they’d acquired.\n\n“We’ll be ready to test tomorrow,” Nora replied. “Which means that we’ll all have to debark.”\n\nCody nodded. They’d moved onto Tristan as soon as they’d got clear title to avoid any “quarks” in their schedule (as Ellaz had put it). It gave them a chance to revise their original plans for the tenders — not only were there Marines aboard but there was an absolutely huge fabrication section including a wide range of techs and engineers, most of them from the Midway Fleet or recruited by the survivors. President Hanlan had hinted broadly that he might have to invoke emergency powers — until Admiral Cartwright had explained how, if he did that, he’d have to give Cody back his rank in the Quark Navy… and his ships.\n\nThe five surviving lightships — Phoenix, Bee, Shifu, Hermes, and Chosen were recognized as belonging to Cody and the survivors of Deneb.

She hit a number of switches, the engines came to life, the airlock slammed shut and the shuttle twisted around, facing the bay doors.\n\n“I know how to fly it!” Cody growled. “I’m just thinking —”\n\n“Well, think faster!” the girl cried.\n\n“We need to wait,” Cody said, taking grip of the joystick in front of him.\n\n“Wait?” the girl cried. “The ship is coming apart all around us!”\n\n“And we’re in a shuttle, we’re safe,” Cody told her, forcing himself to ignore his hammering heart which was busily questioning his sanity. “If we fly out — powered up —”\n\n“They’ll see us and blast us,” the little girl concluded glumly.\n\nCody turned to her.

Then, “Ellaz.”\n\n“Huh?”\n\n“Ellaz Whirly,” the girl said, rolling her eyes at him.\n\n“You’re not on the roster,” Cody said.

Then, her brows furrowed. “Is that why witches are old hags?”\n\n“They’re old hags because they’re stupid little girls,” Hermes said.\n\n“I’m not stupid,” I said. Hermes turned away from me and began licking his rear leg. I had the feeling I was missing something. I raised the bottles in my hands. “So, we’ve got these, what else do we need?”\n\nNatasha bent back to the book, pulling it toward her from Brian. “We need to say the spell and we need something to track her with.”\n\nI raced to the air mattress and picked up the pillow. “She slept here last night.” I glanced about and pulled up a couple of hairs. “Will these do?”\n\n“Those are too long,” Brian said, “not curly.” He frowned a bit and glanced at me. “That’s your hair.”\n\n“Which means you could find Holly,” Hermes said. “You might want to get this right the first time.”\n\n“So… what?” I said. To the book I said, “Erich, can you please tell her what we’re trying to do?”\n\nYes, Erich replied. I have. She says, Thank you! And.. she says she left a scrunchy in the bathroom.\n\n“Scrunchy!” I cried, rushing into the bathroom. Natasha followed right behind me. She spotted it first. Triumphantly, we returned to Brian and the bed. I put the scrunchy and the oils on my table. “Now what?”\n\n“We say the spell,” Natasha said eagerly.\n\n“Wait a minute!” Brian said. “We can locate her, then what?”\n\n“The Lightning Spell!” Natasha cried out. “We can use that!”\n\n“What?” I said. “Shoot lightning at her?”\n\nNatasha shook her head. “No, it’s for speed,” she said. “It makes a person superfast.”\n\n“I thought it made a person invisible,” Brian said, reaching for the book to flip through pages. Natasha pulled it away from him.\n\n“No, they can go so fast that they seem invisible,” she said.\n\n“But she’s being held someplace,” I said. “How do we get inside?”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["epub", "continuation", "v1"]}

Dad, being a teacher, had access to the parking lot. Mr. Herald and Brian followed us in with their car — we’d stopped at their place first.\n\nI was surprised to see the lights on in the administrative section but less so when Mrs. Belle met us at the door to the library.\n\n“Let’s see if we can find this book and settle this argument,” Dad said as we entered the library.\n\n“I’m telling you that —” Scott Herald began only to break off as we entered the library.\n\nI went around the counter and got down on my hands and knees to crawl through into the Caverns. It was still just as disorienting as it had been before. You may be wondering, why wasn’t it pitch black in the caves? It never was, at least at the entry. Zeus was responsible. When I’d tackled him on the subject, he’d declared that it was just a transformation, transforming darkness into light.\n\n“You know, we should have someone down here twenty-four/seven for security,” Mr. Herald said as he came through.\n\n“That would be me,” a voice spoke from the distance. It was Jim Morton.\n\n“I thought you were on assignment!” I said.\n\nHe walked over to us as the rest of the group crawled into view. He grinned. “That’s what everyone is supposed to think.”\n\n“You can’t be down here all the time,” Dad said. “That’s not fair.”\n\n“Well, until we can get more witches,” Mr. Morton said, flashing a look toward me, “and more with security training, we’ve got a mighty small roster to work from.”\n\n“Who else?” Dad said.\n\n“Me,” Mr. Herald said. “I come down when I can to let Jim out to stretch his legs.”\n\n“And bring supplies,” Jim Morton agreed. “Samuel spells me when he can, and Tish will when she gets back.”\n\n“What about me?” I said. “Or Tiffany?”\n\nDad started to speak from behind me but Mr. Morton beat him to it. “Can’t. Anyone who is high profile has got to be extra careful.”\n\n“Brian and Terry found signs of spies at the shop,” I said. “We came here to talk about it.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["epub", "continuation", "v1"]}

There was no point in sentimentality with bodyguards. In fact, there was good reason to avoid it—it was easier when it came time for their funerals.\n\nHe lay back in his bed, wondering whether he should call back and get Sanchez to help him into his legs. He lifted the phone long enough to read the time: 03:14. No, too early.\n\nHe considered taking another sleeping pill but decided against it: they always left him out of sorts, moody, the next day.\n\nAnyway, the pills probably wouldn’t help. It was the same set of dreams he always had—first his sister with her knife and then the explosion that cost him his legs. He shook his head, wishing he could shake the dreams out of it. His conscious mind knew that Carol had nothing to do with the roadside mine that had cost him his legs, but his subconscious insisted on putting her childhood attacks together with the much later explosions.\n\nHe wondered if the dreams were worse because he felt guilty for not visiting Carol.

Sometimes it was harder when she was lucid, when she was the sweet little sister she’d been when they were very young, before she’d started to change and the moods had overtaken her.\n\nThe last time she’d slept in their home had been that night, the one when he’d woken up to see her standing over his bed, slicing down with scissors in her hand.

Kids were below their threshold.”\n\nBrody Shanks swore. “Okay, so the baby’s in — sorry, I think we’ve got ages eight, six, and two — the baby’s in a bad way.”\n\n“Right behind you,” Erin called. “I’m getting the emergency pods ready.”\n\n“That’s a good idea,” her husband agreed. “I’m going to see if I can get inside and talk to them.”\n\n“Have they seen you?” Cody asked.\n\n“I waved to them through a viewport,” Brody replied. “They’re in —\n\n“— the airlock,” Cody finished. “That’s usually the way of it.”\n\n“Roger,” Brody said.\n\nTen minutes later, the three kids were in the shuttle and Cody was moving toward their next target.\n\nThree hours later, Erin Williams said, “Captain, we’re pretty much full.”\n\n“How many?”\n\n“Twenty-two,” Brody said. Then, with an angry rasp, he added, “The oldest is twelve.”\n\n“That’s the age of my XO,” Cody said. “And she’s doing just fine.” Nora was already on the way back to Elantra with a full load. Jacob and Gail had done three trips each, returning to offload their smaller loads and refuel. Scott and Mandy were just approaching Gorin, another space dock, while Eric and Thomas were returning from their investigation of the remains of spacehab Alban. Cody kept an ear on their chatter and commed them privately as their growing despair became more obvious.\n\n“I want them, Cody, I want them!” Eric Doohan growled when Cody talked with him. “You — you can’t imagine —”\n\n“It’s rough,” Cody agreed. “Any luck, though?”\n\n“We found ten — ten! — out of five hundred million!” Eric said in a choked voice. “And they were just lucky — a class trip outside, first time in suits. The oldest is eleven.”\n\n“Sign them up,” Cody said.\n\n“What?”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["epub", "qa", "v1"]}

He pointed a finger to Ellaz. “We’ve trained for that, we can do it.”\n\n“Who are you putting in Engineering?” Moira demanded. “I mean, you’ve got the greater stress, don’t you want —?”\n\n“Thomas Wong and Eric Doohan have agreed to act in tandem,” Brenda Hogg told them. “We’re training, it’s working.”\n\nThe husband and wife exchanged a look, then Clive sighed. “I want to look over the training.”\n\nEdie smiled at them. “You’re going to be doing it right now.”\n\n“Not at Warp Nine,” Moira said.\n\n“Okay, so after,” Cody said. “But, right now… are you up for it?”\n\n“What I don’t get is why Ford is calling the shots,” Tom Walker spoke up.

Cody and Ellaz stuck around long enough to be certain that everything was working, then they left with Gail and Jacob in tow.\n\n#\n\nThe biggest problem was the babies, of course. Especially with Nora’s insistence that they take the bulk of them on Hope. Logically, Revenge made more sense — but she was going farther and would take longer. At some point, the sheer amount of diapers required was a determining factor. Five days against eighty-three.\n\nSo Hope was taking a dozen of the babies — those under three — and Revenge was slated to take the other eight. That meant, paradoxically, that Hope would only have twelve “adults” compared with Revenge’s sixteen. To compensate, Hope had first pick of crew — although some were foregone conclusions, like Gail and Jacob. So, in the “nursery” they had Franny Harper, Johny Sharpe, and Ginny Romba. The first two were eight years old and Ginny was seven. They were serious, dedicated, and not prone to complaining — being all spacer children."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["epub", "qa", "v1"]}

It starts out small, with ‘good reason.’\n\n“Hey, I heard you at school, how was that?”\n\nYou are a witch, you have your full powers, Erich said mournfully. The spell could only protect you until twice dragon.\n\n“Must be some spell,” I muttered to myself. I looked from the kitten to the book under my pillow and frowned. “How come the kitty isn’t eating you?”\n\n“We have come to an arrangement,” Hermes said. No! Wait! NO!\n\n“Cats don’t talk!” I swore.\n\n“I know nothing of that,” Hermes said. He had an English accent! A kitten with an English accent! A kitten that talks! WHAT? “We must talk,” Hermes said, lying down on the bed. “You and your leatherbound — well, we’ll call it ‘leatherbound’ —”\n\nI thought we’d agreed that we wouldn’t talk about that! Erich wailed.\n\nHermes accepted the correction with a nod.\n\n“You can hear the book?” I said to the cat. Okay, I’m talking to a cat! I mean… And then, to Erich — the book — whatever! “You can talk to the cat?”\n\nKitten, Erich corrected. And it’s not.

There were twenty slips — building sites — of which only ten had been occupied. One was gone with the nuking of Nautilus, three were holding the hulks of other nearly-finished ships that were torn to shreds by the alien attack, while the other six had ships in various states of construction ranging from skeletal ribs to partially skinned hulls.\n\nThe ten slips were divided into two groups, each controlled by its own main computer system. Cody had no luck with the first computer so he went out to the second section. He had to figure out the power connections but he managed to get the system to reboot after two hours. He was hot, hungry, tired, scared… and thrilled.\n\nThe main screens came to life and he tapped on the nearest keyboard. Then he had to crack into the system. This was easier than it would have been because he was able to physically get into the computer systems and because there was no one to stop him. Also, he found no less than three different passwords taped in various locations through the computer center.\n\n“Ellaz,” Cody called, “can you connect to this?”\n\n“Sure,” Ellaz chirped, “switch to frequency four. I don’t want us gabbing away at everyone else.”\n\nSurprised, Cody switched frequencies. “Ellaz?”\n\n“I don’t trust them,” Ellaz said immediately. Cody could tell from the echoes that she had her helmet on.\n\n“Trust who?”\n\n“The adults,” Ellaz said. “I think Nora’s right. They’re going to abandon the babies.”\n\n“Okay,” Cody said in a talking-to-a-crazy-person tone. “Why?”\n\n“Simple math,” Ellaz said. “There are too many babies for us and not enough food.”\n\nShe was right.\n\n“So what do you propose?”\n\n“I’m not killing babies,” Ellaz declared. “Either by leaving them or… worse.”\n\n“What if we all die?”\n\n“Then we all die,” Ellaz said. “We’re lucky to be alive. I won’t have their blood on my hands.”\n\n“Okay,” Cody said. “And the best way to avoid that is —”\n\n“Maybe we should send them back,” Ellaz said.\n\n“Who?”\n\n“The adults.”\n\n“Well, don’t we need Edie for the tuning?”\n\n“I could do the tuning,” Ellaz said.\n\n“How many times have you built and tuned warp rings?” Cody asked."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["epub", "qa", "v1"]}

Then, Alistair sighed. “Yes.”\n\n***\n\nI was already awake when the lights in my room snapped on. I turned to see Mom and Dad standing in the doorway.\n\n“I heard,” I told them, sitting up and grabbing my phone. I had nine text messages. I held the phone up to my parents. “What should we do?”\n\n“Tell everyone to get some sleep and we’ll talk in the morning,” Mom suggested.\n\nI nodded and tapped the message to the group. Then I lay back in bed. “Well, at least we got their attention.”\n\n“And they think we’re somewhere in America,” Dad added.\n\n“So they won’t be looking on their own front door,” I said.\n\n“Right,” Dad said, moving to turn off the lights. “Good night, sweetie.”\n\n***\n\nWe had Religion first thing so, of course, after Dad called roll we rushed up to our room and, after the bell rang, made our way to the library and down to the Caverns. Zeus was starting a campaign to call them ‘The Dragon’s Lair’ and I could tell that it was catching on with some of the group. I figured we’d call it the ‘D-L’ when we were in company.\n\nWe met Principal Belle in the Great Hall where she had a trolley laid out with bagels and hot chocolate — a mix of real and faerie food. Brian pigged out on the faerie food. I was tempted but resisted — I’d had a good breakfast. So I had just some real hot chocolate.

He’d failed and while he sometimes treated her like she was just seven — “almost eight!” — most of the time he just kept an amused eye on her progress.\n\n“No, Colonel,” Gail said in mock seriousness, “you’re to watch your tongue around us innocent babes.”\n\n“Of course, admiral, what was I thinking?” Martin replied smoothly.

I’ll be good, I swear.”\n\n“Ach, Mary,” I said, moving to grab her shoulders and give her a hug, “I don’t think that’s what Mr. Henry meant at all.” I hugged her tightly. “And as long as I’ve breath, you’ll have a place with us.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["epub", "summary", "v1"]}

And then, to prove she didn’t mean it, she cocked her head and winked at Wanda.\n\nWanda sat back, upright on her stool, eyes bulging. “Mrs. Balfour?”\n\n“Formerly,” I said to her. “Now you know why she’s so good at English.”\n\n“But crap at Science,” Anna said with a frown.\n\n“I’m good at Science,” Wanda said, meeting Anna’s eyes.

So… not only first day but… starving.\n\nI had my schedule, at least. Printed out, also on my cellphone, and also in my computer. What I didn’t have was a map.\n\nI checked my phone. First stop: Homeroom, Room 204. I remembered that one. It was down from the library, across the blacktop. I saw where the library was and navigated from there.\n\nOf course the door to the room was closed. I was late. So when I opened the door, everyone turned to stare at me.\n\n“Do you have a tardy slip?” A voice from the front of the class — Mrs. Balfour! — called out.\n\n“Huh?” Remember, late? No breakfast, no drive thru coffee.\n\n“Please take a seat, we’ll talk about this after,” Mrs. Balfour said, directing me to the back of the class. I wanted to sit up front, I always wanted to sit up front — it’s safer, no one talks to you and you can hear the teacher better that way. She returned her attention to the rest of the class.\n\nI, of course (no coffee!), stumbled when I pulled out my chair. It made a loud squeaking noise as I pulled it back. Everyone turned to look at me.\n\n“Tardiness is something we do not tolerate at Erasmus,” Mrs. Balfour intoned loudly. “As you can see, it disrupts the students, causing them to lose focus.” She speared me with a glare. “Which is why, if you’re tardy, you must report to Dean Harte at the main office and get a tardy slip. Three tardies will result in a detention.”\n\nFive tardies would result in a parent-teacher conference. Ten could mean expulsion. I’d read the student handbook.

The tickling stopped abruptly to be replaced by a thoughtful silence. The pitch of the ship reminded me where I was — aboard the Danielle in a bed with a French captain of artillery. A captain who thought me just as male as he. Had I spoken too much in my normal voice?\n\nI slid out of the bed.\n\n“Good,” Captain O’Hara’s voice came from behind me, “I need to relieve myself.” He thudded to the deck behind me. “You have the daintiest feet for a man, did anyone ever tell you?”\n\nI huffed at the insult. In truth, I had rather large, manly feet for a girl so I was miffed at his observation.\n\nI pulled the door open and gestured him toward it. “Go, sir, and do your duty.”\n\nCaptain O’Hara laughed at my choice of words but, clearly, his bladder had him in thrall and he was through the door in short order. While he was gone, I hastily dressed, pulling on tunic and jacket. There was no glass in the cabin so I couldn’t say much about my appearance but I was reasonably certain that I looked as much as man this morning as I had the day before, so I took myself off to the galley for whatever food and drink I could find.\n\nCaptain O’Hara joined me not long after, sounding put off that I hadn’t waited for him. “I suppose that’s to be expected,” he allowed, “you’re certainly not much more than skin and bones. Doubtless you’ve got worms, too.”\n\nWorms! It was all I could do to bite back a hot retort.

She pulled off her stockings and, looking in the mirror, reached behind to unhook her bra. Without taking her eyes off the mirror, she slid out of her panties. She straightened up and stood there, nude, looking at the reflection in the mirror as it slowly steamed up. She moved closer and raised a hand to wipe the beads of moisture off the mirror. She swung open the mirror to reveal the shelves in the cabinet behind it. She glanced at her various shades of lipstick and pulled out the reddest one. She closed the cabinet and stared again at her reflection. Irritably, she wiped the moisture off once more and glanced quickly at the water level of the bath. It was slightly more than half-full. She moved over to the faucet, leaned down and turned the water off. She straightened up again and stepped back to the mirror.\n\nThe moisture was kinking her hair. Fine, let it.\n\nShe looked deep into her eyes. She uncapped the lipstick and twisted the bottom to raise the lipstick out of its holder. She looked down at it for a moment, then raised it to the mirror. Just below her eye level, in line with her nose, she carefully wrote: BITCH.\n\nHer lips curled as she examined her handiwork. She raised the lipstick again and beneath the first word wrote: WHORE.\n\nStill not enough.\n\nTears started out of her eyes. She’d heard the words often enough in her life. But it was only now that she thought that perhaps she deserved them.\n\nShe raised the lipstick again but lowered it.

Particularly as the only reason a shuttle would want to burst out of a starship was because there was an emergency. “Going around the side, I’m going to see if there’s a viewport in the airlock door.”\n\nHe thrust his shuttle closer and then rotated so that he was slowly passing down the side of the alien shuttle. It just didn’t look that different. In fact —\n\n“Steve, I don’t think this is alien,” Cody said. Old, maybe but — “Steve, this is a human shuttle.”\n\n“Sir?” Steve Ahmet cried in surprise. “How do you know?”\n\n“Well, there’s writing in English, Spanish, Arabic, and Chinese just outside the airlock,” Cody said. “That, and there’s a ship’s crest — Maru.” Cody blinked. “Steve, this is one of the shuttles from the Maru.”\n\n“And what’s it doing here?” Steve asked. Then, “Incoming, sir. I’ve got a burst transmission — sir! Oh, sir! You’re going to love this!”\n\n“What?”\n\n“I’ll read you the full message: ‘Bout time.’”\n\n“Gail?” Cody asked his heart skipping a beat.\n\n“Yes sir, Commodore Eber has been recovered along with all her crew,” Steve replied. He paused. “They’re suffering from acceleration effects but… the prognosis is good.”\n\n“And her implant?” Cody asked. Implants were wired directly into the brain and Gail’s was recent — under high gees that was not a good mix. Sometimes it was lethal.\n\n“She’s fine, sir,” Ahmet reported a moment later. “And you’re drifting.”\n\nCody looked at his displays and growled to himself. Steve was right.

Everyone was aware of the president’s tendency to ask random questions at times of stress, this was clearly another instance.\n\n“I’m not entirely sure, sir, but I get the idea that she feels connected with Los Angeles, like she’s part of it,” Johnson replied. He added hastily, “I’ve seen the specs on the satellites, sir, and they’re the real deal. With them under her control, she could provide cellphone contact and directional lighting —”\n\n“What?” Green interrupted. “It’s night out there!”\n\n“The satellites are solettas, sir, giant mirrors in the sky,” Johnson replied. “With those thirty satellites she can light up the night.”\n\nThe president was silent for a moment. Finally he nodded. “Okay,” he said. “Tell her that she has my complete authority in the duration of this emergency —”\n\n“Mr. President, you can’t —!” Bancroft barked.\n\n“— my complete authority for the duration of this emergency,” the president reiterated, glaring at Bancroft. “Tell her I’m sorry for what we did and that we’ll try to make it up to her.”\n\nThere was a pause while Johnson relayed the message, then the colonel said, “I understand sir. You have authorized LaReyna, Ellay, and Queen Angel to act as your agent in this emergency — is this being recorded?”\n\n“Everything in the White House is recorded, son,” the president snorted.\n\n“Good,” Johnson said. “She says that she hopes you won’t mind about the Navy and the Army then.”\n\n“What?” Green cried.\n\n“Six minutes,” an aide called out the time.\n\n“If you want, sir, I’ll remain on the line,” Johnson said. “But Ms. Angel says that she’s going to be very busy for the next several hours.”\n\n“Can I talk to her directly?” the president asked, reaching for the handset and taking the phone off speaker.\n\n“Right here, Mr. President,” a young woman’s voice said instantly.\n\n“Ms. Angel,” the president said, “godspeed and good luck.”\n\n“We’ll do our best, sir, but people are going to die.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["epub", "qa", "v1"]}

She took the papers, glanced through them and said, “Yes, yes, quite in order.” She smiled at Wanda. “And what else do you have to offer, my dear?”\n\nDad moved over to me and said into my ear, “How do you recognize a witch?”\n\nI shrugged. I sure didn’t know.

I nodded glumly. “Will he come back?”\n\n“Bessie,” I said, grabbing her by the shoulders and pulling her close, “I don’t know if any of them will come back.”\n\nBessie sobbed against my chest. My tears dripped onto her blond hair.\n\n“Miss!” Meara’ voice interrupted us. I turned to look at her and Mary, coming from their room in the stables. Meara had a very determined look on her face, one that brooked no challenge — the sort of look I got from time to time. “You can’t let him go!” she said to me. “He’s English, if they capture him, they’ll hang him.”\n\nIt took me only a moment to realize that she was referring to Mapes.

And then, inside a warded circle, we tried small magic. Like making our sigils — our little flame signs.\n\nMrs. Belle stayed outside the circle, using the spells she knew to try to locate our magic. Our spells were very small, however, because we weren’t certain we couldn’t be detected.\n\nThe bell rang and we all raced around the room, sweeping up the salt and herbs, re-arranging the desks and putting the room back together.\n\nEnglish was next, with Dad, but honestly, I couldn’t remember what we did, I was too jazzed up from our last class. After that we had Async — Asynchronous Learning — which meant that we broke into groups and studied together. Async was held in one of the large labs up on the second floor where we could spread out and be loud without interfering with each other. I was with Brian, of course, and we whizzed through our module only to look up and find Wanda looking at us wistfully. I held up our module workbook and said, “You too?”\n\nWanda fished through her backpack and pulled out the same workbook, smiling.\n\n“Come on,” I said, gesturing her to sit beside me. “We’ll work on it together.”\n\n“But you’re already done!” Wanda said.\n\n“I am,” I agreed, “but Brian and I will start in on the math module and I’ll answer any questions you have. So we can double-study.”\n\nIt wasn’t two minutes later that Anna tapped me on the shoulder. “Math?” She nodded glumly and leaned down to whisper to me, “I know this, I just can’t remember.”\n\nI pointed to the seat opposite me and she took it.\n\n“How can she know it?” Wanda said under her breath to me. “We haven’t studied it yet.” I shook my head."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["epub", "summary", "v1"]}

His face broke into a grin for a moment and then went coldly grim. “You’re just in time, he’s been calling for you.”\n\n“Mal?” I cried, looking around and realizing that my impulsive ensign was nowhere in sight. “Where is he?”\n\n“We brought him below,” Captain Stoops said, gesturing toward the walker. “The last shot caught him square, he would have gone overboard but for the rigging.”\n\nI’d stopped hearing as soon as he’d said ‘below’ and started racing to the stairs and into the dark bowels of the ship.\n\n“He’s up here, lieutenant,” a seaman said on catching sight of me, my red hair fanning out behind me — my hat being lost somewhere on the deck.\n\n“Lieutenant!” the seaman called as I passed him.

In a lower voice he added, “And do you know what happened next?”\n\n“LaReyna spoke to you.”\n\n“How’d you know?”\n\n“She told me,” Andrea said. She decided not to relay LaReyna’s very precise description of Jim Ryan’s level of panic. “She said she had some work for you.”\n\n“Yeah,” Ryan said, shaking his head. “Do you know how weird it is to try to write code in a jail cell?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“Well, it’s pretty cool, when you get down to it,” Ryan admitted. He started back down the steps. “So what’s next?”\n\n“We’re waiting for a court date,” Andrea said. “And we’ve got a press conference scheduled.”\n\n“When?”\n\n“Oh, didn’t she tell you?” Andrea asked as a small knot of reporters converged on them. “Right now.”\n\nJoe Spiegel stepped forward and nodded to his crew, then to Andrea. “Are you ready?”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["epub", "continuation", "v1"]}

And how are things with the NSA?” Father Lawson said. He pulled the phone away from his ear quickly and said to Smitty, “Excuse me, I think I’ll need to take this elsewhere.”\n\nCatching Smitty’s nod, Father Lawson quickly stepped out of the kitchen and down the hallway toward his room.\n\n“I don’t work for the NSA, Father Lawson, so I wouldn’t know.”\n\n“Then I hope you are doing well at whichever TLA managed to pull you out of CalTech,” Father Lawson said, not missing a beat. “May I assume that this favor has something to do with Mr. Ryan, then?”\n\n“Actually, yes,” Georgia said. “He’s working at DynaCorps and I wanted to wish him luck, but I can’t seem to get through to him.”\n\n“I assume you’re referring to the Fleet Streets project I heard about on my arrival?”\n\n“Yes,” Georgia said, “it’s a very ambitious project.”\n\n“So I would imagine.” Father Lawson’s sleepy brain caught up with itself, and he suddenly thought to wonder how Ms. MacDonald knew his cell phone number and location. Wherever she worked, it had some impressive capabilities. He started to say so, but just then the ground started to sway underneath him and the lights flickered.\n\n#\n\nSmitty sat in his chair at the kitchen table as the voice of Father Lawson faded into the distance. He looked at the cell phone he still held and wondered how it was that a baby could find one and cry into it. Was she hurt? Was her mother hurt and the baby crying?\n\n“Don’t worry, baby, we’ll find you,” he said out loud as a promise.\n\n“Smitty?” a voice spoke suddenly. Smitty looked around, startled; the voice had sounded right next to him. “Smitty?”\n\nThe voice sounded young, immature—scared.\n\n“Hello?”\n\n“Are you Smitty?”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["epub", "paraphrase", "v1"]}

He smiled at me. “One thing’s for certain — they don’t make any smarter than our Danni for these things.”\n\nThe trouble with the boiler, more than anything was the openings. Keeping them from bursting would be the hardest. The same was true for the seals on the cylinder, both from the sides where the steam would enter and leave and also from the top where the piston lever would emerge.\n\nFortunately, I was very good at casting and so I made all the valves and casings myself, careful to ensure that they were built to withstand twice the pressure we’d designed for.\n\n“What if the pressure gets too great?” my father had asked as he looked over the drawings.\n\n“It won’t,” I said, pointing to a small tube coming out of the top of the boiler tank, separate from the output tube. “We’re going to put a small metal cap on that weighed so that it will fall off at more than five atmospheres.”\n\n“And the steam will escape, dropping the pressure,” Jamie said, eagerly following my logic.\n\n“Aye, that works,” father allowed approvingly. “And what about your cylinder, then?”\n\n“Well, if the pressure going in can never exceed five atmospheres, then we needn’t worry about measuring it,” I told him.\n\n“Unless one of your valve sticks or the piston gets cater-cornered,” father objected.\n\n“The piston is big enough it won’t get stuck, father,” Jamie said, pointing to the drawing. He looked to me for the answer to the second question.\n\nI shook my head. “If the valves get stuck, the piston will stop and there’ll be no more movement.”\n\n“Right,” father said, nodding slowly as he considered my words. “I think that should work, then.”\n\n•\n\nThe boiler and engine weren’t my biggest worries. Nor was the platform, as we’d just taken a wagon bed and started from that.

We’d never used wands before. That sounded too… fantasy for me.\n\n“It allows you to concentrate your energy,” Brian said.

So, yeah. Only… it could have been an alien, not a traitor. And I think you’re right about the warp suit. But to miniaturize a warp bubble so small that it could be worn by someone…!\n\nYeah, I know, Cody thought in reply, and was it the aliens who did it or…?\n\nI can’t imagine one person on their own could make it, Ellaz said.\n\nWhich means that either the aliens offered it as part of their bribe —\n\nBut why? Why not just destroy everything? If they knew about the energy converter — She broke off suddenly, shocked by a revelation.\n\nThey didn’t know, Cody replied with a new feeling of certainty. They knew about your mother’s presentation from the traitor and they wanted to be sure that no one continued the work —\n\nBecause it scares them, Ellaz guessed. It scares them enough to — but, the traitor! Who would be willing to sacrifice all of mankind for —\n\nThey didn’t, Cody told her. They only sacrificed some worlds. Maybe they didn’t like those worlds.\n\nCody, Ellaz began slowly, if you’re right then it’s not just one traitor but a whole world — maybe more!\n\nYeah, Cody thought grimly. And we don’t have a clue who they are.\n\nWell, as of now, there are ninety-one possibilities, Ellaz replied. I don’t think it’s Quark but… if we’re wrong —\n\nWe’re heading straight into a trap, Cody replied.\n\nWhat are the aliens running from? Why do they want to destroy our worlds?

The thing is, I wouldn’t be surprised if he had.\n\n“No, I merely pointed Monsieur Mendeleev in the right direction,” Zeus said. There was much pride as he added, “At current market value, the gold alone is worth trillions of dollars.”\n\n“From the size of that pile, that’s about seventy-five millions pounds of gold,” Tiffany said.\n\n“Two trillion dollars worth of gold would be only seventy-four million, four hundred and forty-nine thousand, and seventy-seven pounds of gold,” Brian corrected. Tiffany turned to him.\n\n“You two are not nerding out!” I said, stomping a foot for emphasis.\n\n“Linden, there’s your new car,” Zeus said, waving a hand.\n\n“Um…,” Dad tore himself away from the view long enough to spot Zeus perched on my shoulder, “thanks.” And then he shook himself. “But… if I suddenly turn up with a new car —”\n\n“It would be noticed,” Zeus finished, nodding thoughtfully. “Well, doubtless Holly will figure it out.”\n\n“Me?” I cried. I mean, I wasn’t bad at math — not quite up to Tiffany or Brian — but I’d never even thought of this much money. I waved a hand at the treasure horde. “How much is there?”\n\n“About four times the total wealth of the United States, currently,” Zeus said with more than a little pride.\n\n“That’s more than we need,” I said.\n\n“And you couldn’t spend it all because you’d cause stock market crashes all over the world,” Dad said.\n\n“Huh?” Was all I managed to say.\n\n“It would be bad,” Dad translated.\n\nOn my shoulder, Zeus snorted. “A modest understatement.”\n\nTiffany, however, looked sad. “With this much money, we could feed everyone in the world.” She turned to me with a look that said, Do something!\n\nUp until ten minutes ago, all I was trying to do was stop a digger from pulling out our tree and find enough witches for all the dragons so that Zeus wouldn’t —\n\nI narrowed my eyes and said to my dragon, “What would you have done, if I’d failed?”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["epub", "continuation", "v1"]}

Dad, being a teacher, had access to the parking lot. Mr. Herald and Brian followed us in with their car — we’d stopped at their place first.\n\nI was surprised to see the lights on in the administrative section but less so when Mrs. Belle met us at the door to the library.\n\n“Let’s see if we can find this book and settle this argument,” Dad said as we entered the library.\n\n“I’m telling you that —” Scott Herald began only to break off as we entered the library.\n\nI went around the counter and got down on my hands and knees to crawl through into the Caverns. It was still just as disorienting as it had been before. You may be wondering, why wasn’t it pitch black in the caves? It never was, at least at the entry. Zeus was responsible. When I’d tackled him on the subject, he’d declared that it was just a transformation, transforming darkness into light.\n\n“You know, we should have someone down here twenty-four/seven for security,” Mr. Herald said as he came through.\n\n“That would be me,” a voice spoke from the distance. It was Jim Morton.\n\n“I thought you were on assignment!” I said.\n\nHe walked over to us as the rest of the group crawled into view. He grinned. “That’s what everyone is supposed to think.”\n\n“You can’t be down here all the time,” Dad said. “That’s not fair.”\n\n“Well, until we can get more witches,” Mr. Morton said, flashing a look toward me, “and more with security training, we’ve got a mighty small roster to work from.”\n\n“Who else?” Dad said.\n\n“Me,” Mr. Herald said. “I come down when I can to let Jim out to stretch his legs.”\n\n“And bring supplies,” Jim Morton agreed. “Samuel spells me when he can, and Tish will when she gets back.”\n\n“What about me?” I said. “Or Tiffany?”\n\nDad started to speak from behind me but Mr. Morton beat him to it. “Can’t. Anyone who is high profile has got to be extra careful.”\n\n“Brian and Terry found signs of spies at the shop,” I said. “We came here to talk about it.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["epub", "summary", "v1"]}

Rather, mother was. I was watching in our room. Mom presented “An Investigation Into The Possibilities Of Complete Energy Conversion.”\n\nSo the aliens heard about that?\n\nNot… aliens, Ellaz replied after a moment. Cody, what if someone wanted to steal the energy converter?\n\nBut they didn’t, Cody thought. You still have it. Right?\n\nI… do, Ellaz admitted. But it was damaged, so I hid it. It’s safe. The materials fused. They’re inert now.\n\nOkay, so either someone wanted to steal it and brought an attack that killed fifteen hundred million people or —\n\nThere are aliens, Ellaz replied. Maybe there are.\n\nBut why would they want the energy converter?\n\nThey didn’t, Ellaz thought with a chilling certainty. Someone else did.\n\nSomeone —!? Cody was silent. Finally, Ellaz, are you saying that there’s a traitor? That someone sold us out to aliens so that they could get the energy converter?\n\nOr keep others from getting it, Ellaz thought back.\n\nThere’s a traitor, Cody thought. A traitor with tech no one else has —\n\nMaybe the aliens, Ellaz replied. Maybe he swapped them for it.\n\nBut how did they know?\n\nThe Symposium was announced months — nearly a full year — before, Ellaz replied. Everyone was there. Mom was looking for funding. We were at our limit, almost broke.\n\nI thought you Whirly’s were rich!\n\nWere, Ellaz agreed. The energy converter — it was very expensive. And the research before, even worse.\n\nA warp bubble, Cody thought. If it were possible, the alien could just pop on the ship, and pop back off — the ship could explode around it and it would be protected by the bubble.\n\nYes, Ellaz agreed wearily. Cody… I don’t feel well.\n\nCody glanced to her but she was already out of the simulation. He pulled off his helmet just in time to see Ellaz puke into the trash bucket.\n\n“I need to sleep,” Ellaz said when she’d recovered enough to talk.\n\n“Okay,” Cody said, eyeing her with worry. “Do you want me to carry you back?”\n\n“I can walk,” Ellaz told him testily. She accepted his arm in support, though.\n\n#"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["epub", "paraphrase", "v1"]}

And there isn’t a shipyard I know that’s capable of more than twenty ships at a time.”\n\n“So that’s twelve hundred ships, per system,” Nora replied. “What’s wrong with that?”\n\n“If we can get them all to build ships,” Cody replied. “But —” he nodded to Toby “I think we should advise them to build at least fifty of the Meaths for their planetary defense.”\n\n“How do you get them to listen, though?” Nora asked. “You saw what they did at Perky.”\n\n“We’re going to fix Perky,” Cody said.\n\n“How?

Or do we do whatever it takes to save mankind?”\n\n“Whatever it takes,” Nora said, heaving a heavy sigh.\n\nToby Ramirez nodded in agreement. “Too many are dead already.”\n\n“It’s more than that,” Cody said. “We’re in a fight for survival.

He ran through the list, re-ordered it from smallest to largest. Shuttle power plants were on the list, of course. But they needed… well, at least forty times that power. And how much for ECLSS? And the ring?\n\nHe thought of asking Edie, then of asking Jasmine but they were on the guard frequency so everyone would hear. The computers. They knew.\n\nBut the answer was wild.\n\nWarp rings warped local space so that a ship could travel faster-than-light without breaking the laws of physics. Essentially, the rings created a mini-universe where the rules were different. How well the rings made the universe was reflected in how fast they moved. The better the warp, the faster the apparent speed.\n\nSo if they didn’t have to go too fast, they could use less power. How fast did they need to go?\n\nReally, really, really fast. Faster than the aliens who had already destroyed this system. And how fast was that?\n\nThe next nearest star system was Deneb, twenty light-years away. At the speed of light, it would take them twenty years to get there.\n\n“Five days,” Cody said to himself. He put the numbers into the computer and swore. To go twenty light-years in five days required a warp factor of nine. Freighters usually traveled no faster than warp factor five — taking thirty days to travel twenty light-years.\n\n“Ellaz,” Cody said on their private frequency, “five days. That’s warp factor —”\n\n“Nine, I know,” Ellaz finished for him. “And to do that, you need —”\n\n“The mass, I know,” Cody said. “Well, we’re going to take one of the tanks from a farm, and we know that, right?”\n\n“Just take a tank, hook it up and go?” Ellaz demanded. “You know those farms are anti-matter, right?”\n\n“Of course,” Cody said. “Can’t get warp without anti-matter.”\n\n“And the ratio?”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["epub", "paraphrase", "v1"]}

He sent Doc to provide him light. He found a bright red emergency pod lying on the ground just a meter from the airlock. He peered down at it and saw a dark shape inside. He scanned the readings on the pod… it was losing power, running out of air.\n\n“The pod’s almost out of power,” Cody said. He reached down, picked it up and hooked it to his suit harness. “Heading back.”\n\n“Cody, what if this is a trap?” Steve asked. “I mean, you’re the admiral. If they caught you —”\n\n“Steve, do we detect any other vessels?” Cody said, stepping out of the airlock and pushing himself off the crippled shuttle. He ordered Doc to tow him back to his shuttle’s airlock.\n\nThinking quickly, he hooked the emergency pod onto Doc and had the bot follow him into the airlock. It was crowded. Too crowded. Reluctantly, Cody ordered Doc to leave him with the pod. Then he cycled the lock. Before he walked into his shuttle, he canceled the artificial gravity — no point in trying to lug an awkward pod until he had to.\n\nHe pulled the pod to the rear of the shuttle, near the tiny medical bay. He lowered the pod to the ground and held a hand on it to keep it from bouncing back.\n\n“I’m turning on the gravity,” Cody shouted in warning, dialing up the gravity to half a gee.\n\nThere was a moan and a shriek from inside the pod. And then nothing.\n\nCody leaned down, hit the emergency release on the pod. Nothing. Shit. Cody searched around the med bay desperately until he found a knife — a surgical blade. He knelt down by the pod, pressed against it to be sure that he wasn’t going to press into the body inside and then stabbed the pod. He worked quickly because it started sagging the moment he’d burst the fabric. He cut and cut until he could reach inside. He felt around gently. A nose. There. He cut further and further, racing around the face to cradle the skull. It lolled against his hand, either too weak or… Cody cut faster.\n\n“I’ve got you,” Cody said comfortingly, “I’ve got you.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["epub", "paraphrase", "v1"]}

She closed her eyes and was asleep before Cody had finished talking.\n\nThey made their way back at one gee, relative.

I put them in and stepped back, nodding to Brian. “Now!”\n\nHe stepped forward to throw a spark and the ingredients in the brazier caught, a smooth, white smoke rising with them. The scent of roses came to my nostrils and I smiled. I moved to the side of the cavern and started my line of salt. Natasha was at the other side, working towards me while Tiffany and Brian were working towards each other.\n\n“No!” Zeus bellowed. “You cannot!”\n\n“Why not?” I demanded, still pouring. “If you get free, millions will die.”\n\n“Who says?” Zeus demanded. “How do you know?”\n\n“The earthquakes —” I began.\n\n“Because of magic,” Hermes said, moving over to me. I looked down, surprised. “It’s not because of us, it’s the magic.”\n\n“What?” Tiffany said, staring over at us, her arc finished.\n\n“Us?” I said, staring at Hermes. And — suddenly — he wasn’t a white cat. He was a dragon.\n\n“Aren’t you kind of small for a dragon?” Natasha said to him. She winked at me. “Same green eyes, though.”\n\n“Traitor!” Zeus roared. He turned his gaze to Hermes and a brilliant red flare flashed across the cavern, hitting Hermes squarely on the head. The dragon shape disappeared and only the small kitten remained, flying through the air to hit the rocky wall behind him hard.\n\nHermes crumpled to the ground lifeless.\n\n“You killed him!” I shouted. I finished the arc. There was a brilliant flash and an electric blue light burst from the salt, rushing to the top of the cavern. “You can stay there forever, for all I care.”\n\n“No!” Another dragon, green and much smaller than Zeus, moved forward. Hera. “No, you don’t understand!”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["epub", "continuation", "v1"]}

We’re ready.”\n\n“Confirm,” Moira Collins replied. “Engage on your command.\n\n“Roger, commencing tug,” Cody said. He’d programmed the two heavy lift tugs himself and Mr. Bamber and Miz Collins had double-checked his calculations.\n\nHe watched his display as the two heavy-lift tugs rose above Hope and slowly descended, extending their cables down until they magnetically locked into place.

Already it had been nearly six hours since the first ship was lost and every second was another second lost in saving any survivors. Time was running out.\n\nCody made it to his quarters, threw off his clothes and put himself into the shower. A good shower helped him think.\n\nBut there wasn’t much to think about. There were only two possibilities — they’d gotten his message and were executing a plan or… they’d suffered destruction of their warp capability and were now floating in space with only life support to maintain them. Cody leaned his head into the warm water. Option one was the only one worth following. So... whoever was in command, Gail, Nora, or Emma — possibly all three — were close enough with the other ships to… what? Or did whoever had disappeared first figure the others would guess? And guess what?\n\nThey couldn’t communicate in warp because they didn’t have transmitters. But — Cody glanced up, his eyes wide — if they were close enough that they could communicate in normal space. So, if they dropped to normal space to communicate, then what?\n\nThey could use their higher warp speed to zoom past the aliens and drop in front of them. They could execute an ambush, even. But… how long? When would they attack? And were they thinking about the survivors? Or did they know that there were no survivors, so they didn’t need to worry about them?\n\nWhen they’d hit the alien ship back in Deneb with their warp mirror, the ship had popped violently back into normal space. And, because of that, the ship had turned into “a homogenous mass” as the report read. Metal and biology had been spread evenly throughout the volume the ship occupied. Or, as Ellaz had put it, “They’d become ship goo.”\n\nThere was little reason to hope that any of his ships which had suffered the same attack would avoid the same fate. But… if there was time, it was possible that they’d dropped out of warp before they’d died… and had taken to their shuttles. That they’d survived.

I even managed to coax Bessie into them but she lost her footing and landed rather hard on the ground and we could get her to try them no more.\n\nBut with a steam engine, wouldn’t it be possible to lift stilts? I wondered idly. I built this image in my head. Naturally two stilts wouldn’t be enough — four would be needed like the legs of a large steam horse.\n\nA steam horse! The notion stopped me in my tracks. Someone knocked into me and cursed me for stupidity. I numbly apologized even as the idea burst full-blown in my head.\n\nA steam horse. What could it do? Well, to hear tell about the Newcomen engine, it could run nigh on forever, given enough coal. It would never rest.\n\nMake it big enough — and suddenly I recalled the ancient Trojan Horse — and you could scale castle walls.\n\nMake it a wagon, instead or rather a wagon on stilts and you could mount guns and musketeers and it would be unstoppable, being taller than any cavalryman and more powerful.\n\nSuddenly, I had to see that engine!\n\nI started forward again and quickly broke from my steady walk into a long, slow trot.\n\n•\n\n“A steam horse?” Jamie said to me when I showed him my sketches.

It was still just as disorienting as it had been before. You may be wondering, why wasn’t it pitch black in the caves? It never was, at least at the entry. Zeus was responsible. When I’d tackled him on the subject, he’d declared that it was just a transformation, transforming darkness into light.\n\n“You know, we should have someone down here twenty-four/seven for security,” Mr. Herald said as he came through.\n\n“That would be me,” a voice spoke from the distance. It was Jim Morton.\n\n“I thought you were on assignment!” I said.\n\nHe walked over to us as the rest of the group crawled into view. He grinned. “That’s what everyone is supposed to think.”\n\n“You can’t be down here all the time,” Dad said. “That’s not fair.”\n\n“Well, until we can get more witches,” Mr. Morton said, flashing a look toward me, “and more with security training, we’ve got a mighty small roster to work from.”\n\n“Who else?” Dad said.\n\n“Me,” Mr. Herald said. “I come down when I can to let Jim out to stretch his legs.”\n\n“And bring supplies,” Jim Morton agreed. “Samuel spells me when he can, and Tish will when she gets back.”\n\n“What about me?” I said. “Or Tiffany?”\n\nDad started to speak from behind me but Mr. Morton beat him to it. “Can’t. Anyone who is high profile has got to be extra careful.”\n\n“Brian and Terry found signs of spies at the shop,” I said. “We came here to talk about it.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["epub", "qa", "v1"]}

Smitty’s mouth moved as he tried to find words, then desperately he asked, “Do you believe in angels?”\n\nFather Rodriguez straightened, surprised by the intensity of the question. He turned, motioning for Smitty to follow him. They entered the church and Father Rodriguez made his obeisance and crossed himself, followed a moment later by Smitty. He led Smitty to the back of the church and a door that led into the courtyard of the homeless shelter and back to the rectory. Smitty followed him as they made their way into the kitchen. On the counter, jostled by the earthquake, lay the pink cell phone.\n\n“Our Hector charged it for you,” Father Rodriguez said.\n\n“She called me on it,” Smitty said, accepting the phone gingerly.\n\n“Your angel?”\n\n“She said she had to fix the traffic.”\n\n“I’m afraid that I’ve never heard of an angel using a cell phone,” Father Rodriguez said. “Although I could certainly understand why one might consider fixing our LA traffic. Not that it’s out of the realm of the possible, these days.”\n\nFather Rodriguez turned at the sound of footsteps, his face breaking into a smile as he recognized the woman approaching. “Ah, Magdelena, how are things in the shelter?”\n\n“The women are calming the babies and the babies are calming the women,” Magdelena Jiminez said with an answering smile. “I came to ask about lunch and to start the water for the baby milk.”\n\nFather Rodriguez rose, turning back to Smitty, “I’m afraid we’ve chatted for too long. I need to help Magdelena now and then prepare for Mass.”\n\nSmitty nodded. Father Rodriguez felt awkward and slightly ashamed. “You could come back this evening, if you’re hungry.”\n\n“Thank you,” Smitty said, rising and pocketing the cell phone. With a nod toward the bustling woman, he made his way to the back door and out into the courtyard.\n\n“What did he want, Father?” Magdelena asked as she put a pot of water on the boil.\n\n“He wanted to know if angels use cell phones.”\n\n#"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["epub", "paraphrase", "v1"]}

I was pretty sure that Bessie had tumbled to my plan but she’d have to go along with it, particularly if no one recognized me when we went Guising tonight. If they did, then I’d have to try something else.\n\n“Now remember, for tonight I’m Samuel Clarke just up from the next smithy.”\n\n“Yes, Mr. Clarke,” Mary chirped dutifully, perhaps wary of my hand with the sewing needle.

If there was one place we had to keep an eye on, it was the library.\n\nA red light flashed on one of the monitors. It read: Library Door.\n\n“Hmm,” Mr. Morton said as he brought up the image. “It seems our friend is being busy.” On the screen was a little red-haired girl, moving to the door.\n\n“She’s here?” I cried.\n\n“Did she see us come in?” Dad asked.\n\n“If not,” Brian’s Dad said, “she would have noticed the cars.”\n\n“Why is a little girl here so late at night?” I said. “Who’s with her?”\n\n“Yeah…” Mr. Morton said, bringing up more displays, “Good question!”\n\nI pulled out my phone.\n\n“Who are you calling?” Mr. Morton said, his eyes narrowing.\n\n“We need back up,” I said. “I’m calling Anna.”\n\n“But it’ll take them —”\n\n“Not on dragons!” I said. Anna answered. “Anna, I need you, your Dad, and Erich to fly over to the library immediately. Get your dragons to make you invisible, too. Someone is snooping around outside the Library.”\n\n“On it!” Anna said, hanging up immediately.\n\n“Invisible or not, they still use magic,” Mr. Morton warned.\n\n“And what’s that girl using?” I asked.

Let’s work through them. Also, Nora, I’ve got an idea for how to speed up ring production —\n\nYou do? Brilliant!\n\nAnd congratulations on the babies, Ellaz added, turning to wink at Cody. I’m glad to see that you’re just as smart as I’d predicted.\n\nYou don’t mind? Nora asked. We’re going to take excellent care of them, all of them!\n\nI don’t mind, Ellaz replied. And I hope I’ll get to watch.\n\nOf course!\n\nI’ll help, too, Gail promised.\n\nGreat! Ellaz thought back. Now, let’s get you two up to speed on the implants. And then, when we’re done with that, what sort of tactics have you come up with? I want to see if we can’t destroy these aliens when we meet them.\n\nAgreed! The other three shouted in unison.\n\n#\n\nWow! Ellaz thought to Cody as Dorit pulled off her implant helmet and dropped out of the mind-link. I like her! She’s devious!\n\nI thought you would, Cody agreed.\n\nPity she’s not coming, Ellaz added with a sigh.\n\nWhat?\n\nCody, she’s going to stay here and supervise the reconstruction, Ellaz said. And I’ve agreed to let her keep a copy of me to help.\n\nA copy —!\n\nIt’s okay, Ellaz said. If I don’t want to be, I know how to make that happen and no one will be able to steal that from me.\n\nCody was tempted to ask how but decided that this was one secret that Ellaz should keep for herself.\n\nSo they’re going to drop the fifth space hab ring and move it up to become a space dock, Ellaz thought. I’ve offered to double-check their calculations. Mayor Hartman balked at first and then he and I had a heart-to-heart talk.\n\nHeart-to-heart? Cody repeated.

Light filled it, not quite blindingly but certainly with fullness. I retraced my steps and found the wooden ladder, climbed it and looked about for Captain MacArdle.\n\n“Stand clear, lieutenant!” his voice came down from above me. I stepped aside and looked up. He and his crew were busy with the sails.\n\n“How can I help?” I called up to him. I heard some sniggers from the crew but Captain MacArdle called back down, “Best you can do, sir, is go to the helm and pitch in if they need it.”\n\nI nodded and moved aft. The helmsman nodded at me but seemed in no need of aid, keeping the wheel competently on course. I looked down the length of the ship and noticed that the engine and boiler were covered with a tarpaulin. Ahead I could see a dark smudge of shoreline.\n\n“Why are we sailing in?” I wondered aloud.\n\n“Don’t want anyone to know we’re a steamer, I imagine,” the helmsman replied with a shrug.\n\n“Ah, yes, indeed,” I said, trying to sound as though it were completely expected. For good measure I threw in a yawn.\n\nThe helmsman gave me a look which I interpreted to be disgust that I would still be sleepy. I said nothing, deciding that lieutenants were above noticing such things.\n\nA moment later, the helmsman appeared to change his mind, for he said, “I hear there’s coffee below, in the galley.”\n\n“Would you like a cup?” I asked. “Is it all right to bring a mug on deck here?”\n\n“I’d relish one, thankee, sir.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["epub", "paraphrase", "v1"]}

MacAllister gave me one last glower and then clambered down. On the ground, he called up to me, “Ye can run on home to your daddy, now girl.”\n\nI expected no words of thanks but his tone made it clear that he resented my presence.\n\n“A good evening to you then, Mr. MacAllister,” I said, climbing on down. On the ground, I glanced up at the apprentices. “And a good evening to you too, gentlemen.”\n\n“Gentlemen!” MacAllister scoffed. “I suppose they’re gentlemen in your eyes.”\n\nHis tone angered me and it must have shown in my eyes.\n\n“Ye’re getting old enough to be wed,” MacAllister said, eyeing me appraisingly, “so ye should know now that none of them is gentleman enough for you, lassie.”\n\nHis eyes continued to slither over me.

He’d coordinated with Quark Approach.\n\n“Spinning up,” Gail replied. Cody watched as her lead ships shimmered with the start of their warp bubble. A moment later, Gail’s Mighty joined them.\n\n“Quark Departure, Recon Fleet is clear,” Cody reported. “Request clearance for the Relief Fleet.” That’s what they’d decided to call Cody’s fleet — the fleet that was tasked with aiding Meath.\n\n“Roger, Admiral, your fleet is cleared for departure,” a familiar voice called. It was President Hanlan. “We’ll mind the fort here while you’re off gallivanting.”\n\n“Yes sir,” Cody replied. “And we’ll make regular reports.”\n\n“Yes! We want to keep tabs on you and know that this new-fangled comm of yours really works!”\n\n“Thank you, sir,” Cody replied.

Confirm.”\n\nSix versions of Ellaz replied in the affirmative. Cody shook his head. They hadn’t quite managed to get a direct Ellaz-to-Ellaz link but all of them could easily communicate by radio which was trouble enough.

You know, there’s really nothing better than riding a broom on top of an invisible dragon!\n\n***\n\nThe good news was that, over the weekend, Brian’s dad found us two more witches. We met them at the Harte’s house late on Sunday. They were Boris Seris and his daughter, Julia. Mr. Herald had thought of them immediately when he’d first learned about witches. Boris was a professional weightlifter and Julia took after him. She had the most amazing smile, pure angel. But Brian explained to me that she could lift twice her weight in a “clean jerk” — whatever that meant. He sounded very impressed.\n\nBrian told me, when we were alone, that Julia’s Mom had split some years back. Being Brian, he didn’t say it that way but that’s what he meant. Translating Brian is one of my specialties.\n\nIt seemed like Mr. Seris or Julia had discovered their magic early because Ms. Seris had run away, swearing that there was “too much spooky stuff going on!” That made me sad. Julia looked like a good kid and Mr. Seris was so obviously a loving Dad.\n\n“So we only need to find five more,” I explained to Wanda in Homeroom that morning.\n\n“Just five,” Tiffany said with a disbelieving look. “And we’ve got ten days.”\n\n“Easy peasy,” Nat said in a sing-song tone."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["epub", "continuation", "v1"]}

Her hair was matted, her face bruised and cut.\n\n“Steve, eight or nine year old girl, red hair —” Cody reported. The girl’s eyes snapped open. “Ellaz?”\n\nThe girl looked up at him and screamed.\n\n“Hey, hey!” Cody soothed. She wasn’t Ellaz, her eyes were brown. But the similarities — they were astounding. “I’m Cody Ford, you’re on my shuttle —”\n\nThe girl blinked and shut her mouth. She eyed him — almost exactly the way Ellaz looked at him when she was making up her mind about something — then opened her mouth again but she couldn’t speak.\n\n“Hang on,” Cody said, gently lowering her head to the deck and racing off for an emergency electrolyte drink. He grabbed it, came back, raised her head, opened the drink with his teeth and lowered it to her lips.\n\nShe eyed him and the drink with distaste.

When she was done, she sighed again, nodded with her eyes closed, and whispered, “Germs.”\n\n“Yes,” Cody said. “You’re on my shuttle, we’ve got SAR on the way but I think we should go back to Point Midway — that’s a couple of hours. Do you think you can stand?”\n\nShe barked a laugh and nodded toward her legs. “No,” she said. Cody followed her gaze and gasped in shock — both her legs were bowed outwards.

She was too young to be dating, so Father Lawson guessed she was talking to a relative.\n\nA woman rushed up to her—her mother from her looks—grabbed her by the shoulder and turned her around, pulling the cell phone from her hand.\n\nAs if by some instinct, Hector rolled down his window to let the older woman’s screams reach their ears.\n\n“I don’t care if he’s your father!” the woman screamed. “He’s not here, so he doesn’t get to talk with you!” With an angry thrust, the woman threw the cell phone into the nearest trash can. “You can call on my phone, when you’ve earned it.”\n\nThe girl’s eyes flashed but her mother slapped her once—hard—across the face.\n\n“After all I’ve given up for you, young lady, don’t you dare backtalk!”\n\nThe girl ducked her head in defeat, placed her hands on her guitar, drew a breath and began to sing in a tremulous, haunting voice. Her words were lost in the distance.\n\nLawson could see the open guitar case in front of her, could see the terror in the girl’s eyes and underneath it all a dying hope as she worked: wishing for quarters, hoping for fame.\n\n“It ain’t right,” Smitty said from the back of the car. “It ain’t right what some people do to their own.”\n\nFather Lawson pursed his lips and nodded; that was the very same sentiment that had driven him into the Order.\n\n“That’s what you wanted to see?” Hector asked softly.\n\n“That’s what I was hoping I wouldn’t see.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["epub", "continuation", "v1"]}

Then she pounced on them and hugged them, kissing them and squeezing them. “It’s so good to see you!”\n\n“You, too,” Cody agreed, kissing the top of her head and hugging her back.

In fact, I noticed that he was helping Bessie a lot. Oh, they were just kids but it was clear that there was some feeling between them. Even Mr. Stoops remarked on it.\n\n“I’ve seen it be that sometimes two people get together and just stick,” he said when I mentioned it. His eyes danced as he added, “I think we all saw that with you and your Mr. Cattan.”\n\nI blushed but couldn’t say anything.\n\nWith Mal — as he was soon called — helping, it was easier to keep a watch at night.\n\nI was exempted no matter how hard I tried to take a place as were Mary and Bessie.

And what would they do with a pretty young thing like yourself?”\n\n“But they’re supposed to think that I’m Samuel Clarke,” I protested.\n\n“Aye, and if they did, they’d have no problem busting your head wide open if they had to,” Mr. Henry had replied, shaking his own head firmly. “No, I couldn’t answer to your father if that happened.”\n\nAnd so I stayed indoors at night and slept with the girls.\n\nThe two trotters grew more real day by day.

He tapped a command and another screen flickered to life, showing their ships and the aliens’. Cody nodded in thanks to him and Steve grinned back.\n\nCody watched in growing despair as Gail’s fleet diminished from seven to five… and then to three. There was still one enemy ship closing in on Midway, though they probably didn’t know it.\n\nFinally, there was a cry of joy from the sensor crew. “Confirmed!

Two minutes later, Boris reported, “Two ships slowing, reversing course, sir.”\n\n“Good,” Cody said. He didn’t know which two ships had survived, there was no way of knowing at that distance but at least their turning around proved that they’d — “Boris, have we got the masses on those two ships?”\n\n“Um… checking, sir,” Boris said immediately.\n\n“Our tracking indicated that they were ours,” Ursula added hopefully.\n\n“Yeah, but wouldn’t it suck if we were wrong?” Cody replied.\n\n“Right,” Ursula agreed. Two minutes later she turned to him, smiling, “We have a ninety percent confidence that both ships are below two megatonnes in mass.”\n\nWhew!

I gave Mr. Lucks — er, Doctor Lucks — a look and he returned it with a small jerk of his head and a sad smile.\n\n“Not all witches are good,” Zeus murmured in my ear.\n\n“Heather?” I whispered back.\n\n“Her father,” Zeus said. “The magic was male. So was the pain.”\n\nI suddenly felt quite ill. I raised my hand. “I don’t feel well, can I be excused?”\n\nMr. Beamer gave me a concerned look but nodded.\n\n“Can I go with her?” Tiffany said, rising by my side.\n\n“I’ll look after your things,” Anna said, nodding to Zeus and rising from her seat to take him off my shoulder.\n\n“Black magic,” I whispered to her. Her eyes went wide for a moment but she nodded and went back to her seat.\n\n***\n\nOutside, I rushed to the bathroom and threw up. Tiffany waited until I was done, helped me clean up and gave me a hard look, her arms crossed demandingly.\n\n“Black magic,” I said, my stomach heaving again. “He used black magic on his daughter!”\n\n“Mr. Rourke?” Tiffany guessed.

Her tone changed as she spoke, as if to break the news to me gently. I thought about it and realized that Bessie, with her errands and all, would have a better ear for the gossip of the town than I ever would. She was more intrigued by such things; I was more intrigued by machines.\n\n“I’ve put some money by — ”\n\n“Did you see the prices at the market?” Bessie asked. I shook my head. “They’re going up, people are afraid and the merchants are charging what they can.”\n\n“Bessie,” I said to her, taking a breath and speaking calmly, “I have to go.”\n\n“Why?” Mary asked, moving to huddle closer to Bessie in a way that nearly broke my heart.\n\nI looked down and met her eyes. “Because, sweeting, if we don’t help the Prince win, father and Jamie — at least — will both be for the hangman. Or worse.”\n\nI could see that they were worried but that neither of them quite understood.\n\n“The walkers and the trotters are such that every King and every army will have to have them once they see them,” I told them.\n\n“But doesn’t that mean you and your family will be safe then, Miss?” Bessie asked. “Won’t they need you to build more?”\n\n“Or they could kill us to keep us from doing the same,” I told her. “Or lock us in their dungeon and force us to do their bidding.”\n\n“You should never have made them, Miss,” Bessie told me sternly. “I tried to warn you what happens when a girl gets notions.”\n\n“It’s too late for ‘ifs and ands’,” I said. “They’re built now, they’re going off to war, and the only choice we’ve got is whether to help the Prince win or to lose alongside him and the army.” I sighed. “If they lose, it won’t be long before the English will be up here looking for those who built them.”\n\n“And they’ll get me, acting as you,” Bessie said, wide-eyed with fright."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["epub", "continuation", "v1"]}

It hadn’t changed shape since the first day he’d seen it.\n\n“Well, it was darned good work,” Egan said appreciatively. “But for the moment, I’m more worried that we can’t get the nanotech working than I am about the accuracy of your predictions.”\n\n“Yeah,” Ryan agreed with a grumble.\n\nSince Ryan’s return they’d worked over a week without anything to show for it. Of them all, Egan remained the most optimistic; assuring them that he hadn’t expected miracles and admitting that he’d done the same sort of hare-brained stunts that Ryan had pulled to make the original Fleet Streets date.\n\nWith the backups restored, it had taken Ryan days to realize that his last work was not included in it.\n\n“We back up every twenty-four hours starting at midnight,” Mackey had explained. He made a face. “The backups take time and, from the logs, we didn’t get to your home directories until about six am.”\n\n“By which time, he’d been suspended, so his account was disabled and not backed up,” Egan had surmised bitterly. He’d turned to Ryan, “So anything you’d done in your last twenty-four hours isn’t in this backup.”\n\nWhich had included too much of his experimental code. The very code that had linked the nanotech to Fleet Streets. The code they needed.\n\nAnd so, growing more stressed every day, Ryan had tried without success to re-create the code that had been lost. There’d been one morning when the mass of nanotech had moved, had seemed to start assembling itself, but it had collapsed moments later back.\n\n“Hah!” Harvey Steilman shouted exultantly, slapping his desk. Ryan turned to the lab bench and then, when he realized nothing had changed, to Steilman. “I think I’ve got it,” Harvey said in answer to Ryan’s questioning look. “That new language of yours is brilliant, you know—”\n\n“It’s not mine,” Ryan replied, “it was hers.”\n\n“—of hers, then,” Steilman continued with an acknowledging wave of his hand.

Looking at it, I decided that they’d done a good job getting the fire going again. I glanced at the pile of coal I’d left for feed and saw that they’d been good — they hadn’t pilfered any or used it up during the night.\n\n“That was a girl!” a boy’s voice hissed loudly under the archway as the urchins scarpered. That remark was answered by muffled guffaws from the others.\n\nMy secret was safe, I could tell. Not that anyone would ever listen to a homeless orphan nor would any orphan be foolish enough to speak where the wrong ears might hear.

I turned around twice, shaking my hands to get a feel for magic and then I thought of Brian and threw my quarter to the ground.\n\n“You walked right past me,” Brian said as he appeared not two feet away from me. “It worked.”\n“So did mine,” I said. I pointed back to his lab. “Let’s do that again.” He nodded and rose, leading the way. “Got any more quarters?”\n\n“Some dimes,” Brian said.\n\n“Quarters are better,” I said. “Although I suppose we could just use rocks.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["epub", "continuation", "v1"]}

Ellay gave a shriek of delight, and then Smitty found the wheels on his chair turning themselves as they raced toward the elevator.\n\n“You there!” a voice called from behind him. “Hold up!”\n\nSmitty pawed frantically at the down button as from behind him he heard the sound of two men racing down the corridor.

By the time Moira got back with the others, they’d be down to seven days.\n\n#\n\nThe bots were good, but they needed someone to check up on them. Some of the bots had been damaged in the attack and it took Cody a while — and mistakes — to separate the good from the bad.\n\n“You know,” Edie said the next day, “if we’re building one we could build two.”\n\n“Don’t we need —?” Cody began. He was going to say “ring material” but he realized that they only needed half as much as a regular freighter because they were only using one warp ring.\n\n“You need to help Nora,” Ellaz said when Cody came in from repairing another ailing bot.

And how are things with the NSA?” Father Lawson said. He pulled the phone away from his ear quickly and said to Smitty, “Excuse me, I think I’ll need to take this elsewhere.”\n\nCatching Smitty’s nod, Father Lawson quickly stepped out of the kitchen and down the hallway toward his room.\n\n“I don’t work for the NSA, Father Lawson, so I wouldn’t know.”\n\n“Then I hope you are doing well at whichever TLA managed to pull you out of CalTech,” Father Lawson said, not missing a beat. “May I assume that this favor has something to do with Mr. Ryan, then?”\n\n“Actually, yes,” Georgia said. “He’s working at DynaCorps and I wanted to wish him luck, but I can’t seem to get through to him.”\n\n“I assume you’re referring to the Fleet Streets project I heard about on my arrival?”\n\n“Yes,” Georgia said, “it’s a very ambitious project.”\n\n“So I would imagine.” Father Lawson’s sleepy brain caught up with itself, and he suddenly thought to wonder how Ms. MacDonald knew his cell phone number and location.

They were just coming up to their position when the Dominion’s boiler blew. Even from where we were, we could hear the screams as the steam boiled the four men alive.\n\nApparently, it was their horrid screams that convinced the defenders that we must be in league with the Devil and impelled their surrender.\n\nHamish at first tried to blame the design for the fault until Captain Finlayson recovered the heavy plug. A surreptitious inspection of Hamish’s Destroyer revealed that it, too, had an eight atmosphere plug in place.\n\nNeedless to say, the rest of the walkers were kept to the proper five atmospheres and, after this sad event, we had no trouble in ensuring that all the walkers were oiled and inspected daily.\n\nWe now march south, with five walkers, two in the van and the other three interspersed throughout the column.

He sent Doc to provide him light. He found a bright red emergency pod lying on the ground just a meter from the airlock. He peered down at it and saw a dark shape inside. He scanned the readings on the pod… it was losing power, running out of air.\n\n“The pod’s almost out of power,” Cody said. He reached down, picked it up and hooked it to his suit harness. “Heading back.”\n\n“Cody, what if this is a trap?” Steve asked. “I mean, you’re the admiral. If they caught you —”\n\n“Steve, do we detect any other vessels?” Cody said, stepping out of the airlock and pushing himself off the crippled shuttle. He ordered Doc to tow him back to his shuttle’s airlock.\n\nThinking quickly, he hooked the emergency pod onto Doc and had the bot follow him into the airlock. It was crowded. Too crowded. Reluctantly, Cody ordered Doc to leave him with the pod. Then he cycled the lock. Before he walked into his shuttle, he canceled the artificial gravity — no point in trying to lug an awkward pod until he had to.\n\nHe pulled the pod to the rear of the shuttle, near the tiny medical bay. He lowered the pod to the ground and held a hand on it to keep it from bouncing back.\n\n“I’m turning on the gravity,” Cody shouted in warning, dialing up the gravity to half a gee.\n\nThere was a moan and a shriek from inside the pod. And then nothing.\n\nCody leaned down, hit the emergency release on the pod. Nothing. Shit. Cody searched around the med bay desperately until he found a knife — a surgical blade. He knelt down by the pod, pressed against it to be sure that he wasn’t going to press into the body inside and then stabbed the pod. He worked quickly because it started sagging the moment he’d burst the fabric. He cut and cut until he could reach inside. He felt around gently. A nose. There. He cut further and further, racing around the face to cradle the skull. It lolled against his hand, either too weak or… Cody cut faster.\n\n“I’ve got you,” Cody said comfortingly, “I’ve got you.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["epub", "qa", "v1"]}

But he knew better—he recognized those headlines. The headlines locked away in the special folder that no one was supposed to be able to find, files encrypted with a code that no one was supposed to be able to break. But Egan was quoting headlines at him and that meant Egan had cracked the codes.\n\nHe turned at a noise: Egan’s printer had started printing.

The lights in the room rose at some unseen command, probably typed in by Egan, so that there was enough light for Ira to easily read the documents.\n\n“You don’t seriously expect me to sign this, do you?” Ira said angrily.\n\n“Oh, the first one’s just insurance,” Egan said dismissively. “I’ll keep it on file.”\n\n“This is an admission of deliberate corporate sabotage,” Ira said. “If I sign this, you could use it to send me to jail!”\n\n“That’s right,” Egan said. “I figure you’d probably only get five years.

Turn it into some kind of radar?\n\nWell, isn’t it? Cody said. And what if the computers get it wrong? For that matter, how are they seeing in warp?\n\nWarp gravitics, Ellaz replied immediately, with a condescending tone. Honestly! Didn’t they teach you anything?\n\nAbout shuttles and normal space, Cody reminded her.\n\nWhen you’re in warp, you’re not completely cut off from the rest of the universe, Ellaz lectured. So we can look through to normal space and interpolate what’s in front of us, like big rocks and other hazardous clumps.\n\nAnd the faster we go, the harder it is to see, Cody agreed. Which is why we award probabilities, make the images bigger and fuzzy.\n\nYes, Ellaz agreed. But that doesn’t help you detect warp bodies.\n\nWait a minute! Cody thought. Parts of a warp bubble hook back to normal space. He thought of the fuzzy alien he’d seen on Hornet. So there are traces back in normal spaces. Like little spikes or slivers.\n\nBut they’d be so small, Cody, you couldn’t separate them from space dust, Ellaz said.\n\nSpace dust traveling at warp speed? Cody countered.\n\nThen you’d need a really large array and super high speed computers with imaging resolution that… Ellaz stopped. It could be done.\n\nAnd we’re sort of doing it already, Cody thought back.\n\n“Cody?” Nora’s voice came to him. “I’m ready to take over.”\n\n“Hang on,” Cody told her, waving his hand. “Ellaz and I are onto something.”\n\nNora was silent for a long while.

She nodded to Cody. “Starship?”\n\n“We were hoping,” Cody admitted.\n\n“And energy?” Edie said, glancing to Ellaz. Ellaz hissed in surprise, forced her mouth to work in an attempt at a reply but was cut off by Edie’s raised hand. “I’m a ring master, I keep my eyes open.”\n\n“And a single ring?” Ellaz shot back. “Do you know how —?”\n\n“No, why don’t you tell me?” Edie broke in.\n\nEllaz glared at Cody, then sighed when she looked back to Edie. “I’ve been running the math.”\n\n“N-space manifold, right?” Edie guessed, tapping her temple implants for emphasis.\n\n“Well… yes,” Ellaz admitted. She shot a quick look to Cody, adding, “Mother and I were examining some interesting —”\n\n“Mother?” Edie broke in. She glanced between Cody and Edie. “I thought you were clones.”\n\n“Yes,” Cody said.\n\nEdie considered that, her eyes narrowed as she examined Ellaz’s face. “You’re a Whirly!”\n\n“I —!” Ellaz began in protest. But the look on Edie’s face told her that she wouldn’t get away with it. “Yes, but it’s classified.”\n\n“Who was your mother?” Edie asked in a softer voice. “I’ve worked with some Whirly’s in my time.”\n\n“Elle Dann Triple Vonn,” Ellaz said.\n\nEdie’s eyes went wide. “EDTV?” Ellaz nodded. “And you are…?”\n\n“Ellaz Conn Venier Four,” Ellaz replied.

Then I straightened and drew the gesture in the air with my fingers. “First you have to see the gesture.” I drew where my arm had been and dropped down to follow the flow from my arm to the end of my outstretched foot. “Then you draw the rest of the body.” I stood back up, drew a tilted line for my head and spine, trailing down to the foot that had been planted on the floor.\n\nBang! Bang! Bang! “Girls!” It was Mrs. Balfour.\n\n“I think the Dean hates her,” I whispered to Tiffany. I reached down a hand to help her up.

Boris Kelner was another one of the “interesting” people Cody had received for his command station. Cody was ready to bet that Admiral Cartwright had wrung out every body they could find for their crash fleet construction and the ones he couldn’t shake himself free of, he’d assigned to Cody in a perverse quirk of humor.\n\nIt hadn’t worked. Cody had experience getting six year-olds to build starships, so centenarians weren’t any trouble to him — once he firmly established that he outranked them.\n\nBoris was totally in love with the grav array system and made it his baby from the moment he was introduced to it. He drove his people hard. He was an exacting taskmaster — exactly the type they needed to work out all the kinks and quirks of the gravity arrays that they’d hurriedly transhipped from Cody’s fleet to Harper for transport out here to “the middle of nowhere.”\n\nWhen he wasn’t busy bossing that crew, he was positioning and arguing about the placements of the AMCs they brought out as their “space mines” — as Boris called them. And working on the tachyonic transmitter, receiver, and the special detectors they’d built for the mines.\n\nThey were lucky in that they’d figured out how to haul no less than one hundred AMCs out here to “Point Midway.” They’d positioned the AMCs far in front of the grav arrays. The grav arrays would detect the alien fleet and, when they were close enough, would fire the space mines. Hopefully, they’d destroy some of the alien’s ships. If not, they would certainly cause a huge distraction which — with luck — would keep them from looking behind them and spotting Cody’s fleet.\n\nWhich, Cody thought with another sigh, he would direct from here, Midway Command. Commodore Emma Forster had taken command of his ships. Cody had moved Gail over to her own command, the Left Squadron, while Nora still kept the Right Squadron.

The church and the grounds were silent, its occupants inside or otherwise engaged. “But I suppose we could at that, if you’ve got the time.”\n\n“I do,” Ellay said. She looked up at Smitty. “Do you think the butterflies will be out?”\n\n“Maybe,” he said, “if we’re lucky.” He glanced down at her. “Why? Thinking of catching one?”\n\nShe gave him a grin. “Let’s just go!”\n\nThey walked together in silence. Every now and then, Ellay would stop and look around, sometimes asking Smitty a question which he’d answer as best he could.\n\nWhen they got to Runyon Park, Ellay led the way towards a group of likely bushes. Smitty, somewhat winded, followed her at a more leisurely pace until he heard her suddenly cackle with glee. “I got one! I got one!”\n\nSmitty picked up his pace and soon arrived in a small clearing where Ellay stood with one hand clasped atop the other, a triumphant look on her face.\n\n“I got it, Smitty, I got it!” She cried cheerfully, raising her hands toward him. “See, I’m big enough. I can do it now!”\n\n“You are, indeed,” Smitty said, feeling a slight pang in his heart. “All grown up and all.”\n\nEllay caught his tone; some of her cheer evaporated. “Do you want to see?”\n\n“Sure, hang on,” Smitty said, kneeling so he was at her height. “Go on then, show.”\n\n“I can feel it fluttering in my hands.”\n\n“It’s trying to get out.”\n\n“I’m going to open my hands just a little, so you can see,” Ellay said.

Ermingand.” He waited to see her reaction but she didn’t even twitch.\n\n#\n\nEthel and Ermingand turned out to be based off of two med bots which Ellaz thought was cheating and she wasn’t shy about telling Cody so. Cody merely smiled, adding, “And I took fifteen minutes, for the record.”\n\nEllaz shook her head in disgust.\n\nNora came rushing down four hours later, flushed with worry only to find Ellaz saying, “Pawn to Queen Four. Again.”\n\n“How are the babies?”\n\n“See for yourself,” Ellaz said, waving a hand around. “And we got Tommy and Torrance playing with the toddlers.” Nora glanced around to spot two bots leading two columns of cheerful toddlers racing around the room and singing, “Row Your Boat.”\n\n“Why would anyone row a boat?” Cody asked.\n\n“It was an old naval thing,” Nora explained. “A boat with two wooden paddles that you could move in tandem.” She frowned. “But you had to face to the rear.”\n\n“That seems… awkward,” Ellaz said. She yawned. Then she added, “And we took a look —”\n\n“A look?” Nora said, eyebrows raised.\n\n“Sorry about your mother,” Cody said.\n\n“And your family,” Ellaz added, glaring at the older boy.\n\n“Yeah,” Cody said.\n\n“Oh!” Nora said in a small voice. “I hadn’t — I mean, there were the babies and — there was no time —”\n\n“I know,” Ellaz said. “But you didn’t mention that your mother was the base commander!”\n\nNora’s lips twitched. “She wanted me to take over.”\n\n“You’d do a good job,” Cody said comfortingly.\n\n“Except that there’s no base anymore,” Nora said. She shot a look to Cody. “Can I come with you?”\n\n“Well, someone has to watch the babies!” Ellaz said.\n\n“I think, what she means to say is that we’d be delighted,” Cody said, shaking his head at Ellaz. “She has no tact, you see.”\n\n“What’s tact?” Ellaz demanded.\n\n“Later,” Cody said. “Nora, do you think you can manage for a bit? We’ve got to check on the construction.”\n\n“Okay,” Nora said with a resigned sigh.\n\nCody lifted his arm and tapped his communicator. “Call if you need anything.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["epub", "summary", "v1"]}

The line went dead and he hung it up. He looked around the room at all the faces looking at him expectantly.\n\n“You all heard me,” he told them. “Anything she orders, it’s authorized.”\n\n“Mr. President, you’re not going to trust —” Secretary Green began pleadingly.\n\n“John,” the president cut across him quietly, “she could have destroyed us all already and she didn’t.” He nodded firmly. “So we’re going to trust her and assume that she’s willing to act in our best interests.”\n\n“It’s your decision, Mr. President,” Linda Worthington spoke up from the doorway. The president turned toward her, realizing that she must just recently have returned.\n\n“Yes it is,” the President agreed, turning to Bancroft and Green. “And I expect it to be obeyed.”\n\n“Yes sir,” Green said quickly.\n\n“I’ll tell FEMA, sir,” Bancroft said, still looking anxious.\n\n“Five minutes,” the aide warned.\n\n#\n\nSanta Monica Pier\nSanta Monica, CA\n[T-0]\n\nNine minutes wasn’t enough. Ryan knew it and hung back with the cop as they herded people forward. The cop had pulled a bullhorn from the first shop and had immediately used it to urge people off the pier, walking quickly from shop to shop, ride to ride, forcing them to off-load and shut down. He knew his job and Ryan admired the cool way the cop performed it even as his own nervousness increased with every passing minute.\n\nPeople balked and argued but the cop was firm, pulling his truncheon and waving it toward the end of the pier.\n\n“Attention! Attention! By order of the Santa Monica Police Department, the pier is closed!” the cop roared over the bullhorn.\n\nThey were in line with the merry-go-round. People were still moving sluggishly, sauntering toward the end of the pier when the P-wave sent a jolt through them all.\n\nImmediately the atmosphere changed and people started stampeding up the hill at the end of the pier.\n\n“Jeez!” the cop said as he reached out with one hand to grab a handrail. He turned to Ryan. “That was strong.”\n\n“6.7 in Whittier,” Ryan told him.\n\nHe had barely finished saying it when the stronger motion of the S-wave rippled toward them from the shore."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["epub", "continuation", "v1"]}

They’d worked together flawlessly but Hartman was right in saying that she deserved a command chair, and they’d managed to find someone — Jackie Quinn — who’d been more than willing to swap. They’d given her Whirly for her command. She’d worked her butt off with her new XO, Simon Schlachter until even Ellaz was impressed. “And I’ll have the left section with Captain Eber as my second.” Gail smiled at him. After her, they’d put Jacob on Glorious — his name for his first command.\n\n“Now, as soon as we reach Quark, we’ll detach Commodore Hartman in Hermes and head back out to deploy our arrays,” Cody reminded them. “Once the arrays are established, we’ll rotate our ships out — one in three — for rest and refueling if required.” He paused. “We’re hoping that we’ve got a six to eight day lead on them.” Heads nodded. “After that, when we’ve detected them and verified that they’ve passed, we’ll go into warp and chase after them stealthily. Our plan is to hit them two to three days before they’re due to arrive at Quark. With luck, we’ll hit them fast, hard, and unseen.” He smiled. “And then, when we’re done with them, we get down to the real business.”\n\n“Finding their homeworld,” Derval Connors growled.\n\n“And putting an end to it,” Eric Doohan added fiercely.\n\nCody waited a moment. “Any questions?” He glanced around. “No? Well, back to work, people! And don’t forget to rest!”\n\nThe group roared with laughter and then rose, dispersing to their various duties.\n\n#\n\nThey worked all night, sleeping in shifts. By dawn, twenty-six ships were ready to be lifted up into lunar orbit. The other four would follow on in the next few days.\n\nNora insisted that her Phoenix was first. Cody let her go, hugging her before she boarded her ship.

She half-listened as Ms. Angel told her about her predictions and the need for better sensor data and higher resolution displays, but most of her attention was focused on Ryan.\n\nHe seemed totally besotted with his new boss. Georgia suppressed her irritation. Slowly, though, Georgia felt her irritation alter. Ryan wasn’t looking at this woman with lust, he was looking at her in awe. And then Georgia turned her total attention to what LaReyna Angel was saying.\n\n“You developed a new symbolic language?” Georgia interrupted in surprise.\n\n“Nah,” Ryan corrected her, “she developed a whole new way of describing things.”\n\n“I’d be interested in learning more about this,” Father Lawson said, sounding nearly as excited as Ryan. He turned to Georgia, “This whole concept of flows and fields seems to describe higher level physics in an extremely elegant manner.”\n\n“It’s really hard to learn,” Ryan warned him. He nodded toward LaReyna. “I still don’t think I’ve got a full grasp on it—”\n\n“Oh,” LaReyna told him with a quick wave of her slim hand, “you’ll catch on.”\n\nCatch on? Georgia repeated silently to herself. Jim Ryan catch on to a new language? He’d taught himself every language, starting in middle school when he’d taught himself C#, and moving on to his own SymLog which was the first half of his doctoral dissertation. How smart was this person? Georgia wondered as she looked at the deceptively slim young woman seated beside her. And why did she wear her hair so short? Was it some sort of retro-punk fashion? Where did she come from, Georgia wondered, noticing that her voice had the slightest trace of something exotic, like English wasn’t her first language.\n\n“The thing is,” Ryan said, unable to contain himself, “not only has she developed a new language, she’s figured out how to accurately describe seismological activity.”\n\n“Earthquakes?” Georgia said. Why bother with earthquakes when this new language could pull information from any source in an instant?\n\n“How far out?” Father Lawson asked.\n\n“There will be a triple event in the greater Los Angeles area at 3:14 am on the twenty-second of February next year,” LaReyna declared.\n\n“A triple event?” Georgia repeated, incredulously."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["epub", "continuation", "v1"]}

Her father looked at her in alarm. She passed the half-empty bag of popcorn off to her father and raced out of the room.\n\n“Where are you going?”\n\n“I’ve got to tell someone!”\n\n#\n\nJim Ryan’s Apartment, Santa Monica, CA\n\nDecember 25th, D-Day: -59, 01:13 PST UTC-8\n\n“Jesus fucking Christ!” Ryan swore as he pulled the pillow back over his head. Would they never stop banging on the walls?\n\nHe’d planned on being in the office later that day, and he’d wanted his sleep. He’d been working solidly, ignoring all the idiot press and the loony psychics to concentrate on getting the predictions refined, on working up the list of buildings in danger and so far he had … nothing.\n\nThe computers at work were complete crap compared to what LaReyna could do with her nanotech. There was no way in hell that he could coax them into the sort of supreme power and elegance she’d managed to display.\n\nHe’d gotten clever in the end—he’d used the computer language she’d invented. That had helped him make the most headway, but even so …\n\nAnd the worst of it was, Ryan was beginning to suspect that even LaReyna was wrong. That worried him. She was clearly the smartest thing that had ever existed, but her Achilles heel had been the amount of nanotech she had. With too little nanotech, she was doing no more than educated guesses—more educated than anyone in the world, but guesses all the same.\n\nWhen he’d realized that, he’d stayed home for the better part of a week. What if she was wrong? What if the quakes weren’t going to come? What if that asshole Carrington at CalTech was right to call him a nut job?\n\nBut then Ryan had thought about the new language, had really dug into it … and he’d realized exactly how amazingly smart LaReyna had been. The language had depths he was only beginning to plumb.

Then I checked the date they were checked out — there was only one that was overdue, so I left that for Dad. I found the cool rubber date stamp and the stamp pad and marked the return date on all the books that had come back. Then I put the little cards in the sleeves in the books. After that, I piled the returned books on a cart. I used the cart and wheeled from row to row. It was fun. There were only about twenty books to shelve, so it didn’t take long.\n\nWhen I was done, I parked the cart back where I’d got it. Then I went looking.\n\n“Magic or religion?” I said to myself. “Or fantasy?” I was wrong.\n\nI found the book filed under ‘D’ for dragon. “There you are!” I frowned as I pulled it from the shelf. It looked odd. Not the way I remembered it. “Did someone hurt you?” I said, incensed that any of our group might not treat the book carefully. The cover looked almost red. And there was a bulge in the front, on the right side, just in the middle. I ran my hand over it — and dropped the book as a spark of magic jerked through me. I caught it before it hit the floor and the same spark of magic flowed into me.\n\nMagic flowed into me. Wait! Dragons give magic. But I’d never felt it this way before.\n\n“Eric?” I said to the Book Without Ends. Eric?\n\n“Holly?” A voice spoke. Not Eric, though. Zeus. He appeared hovering in front of me. “What is that?”\n\nAnd suddenly, my hands were burning. I looked at them, expecting blisters to appear but they didn’t.\n\n“It’s the book,” I told him, “and it’s burning my hands!”\n\nThe book glowed brightly and then it stopped and my hands felt normal.\n\nBut the book didn’t. The bulge moved under my fingers and I pulled them back. The bulge had become rounded and more raised. It was like an oval.\n\n“Zeus, what’s happening to the book?” I cried, looking over at him."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["epub", "summary", "v1"]}

Cody had bet that their support would take ten days to get there.\n\n“Sure,” Cody said, raising his wristcomm to enter a number and swipe it over to Nora. They were sending credits back and forth. Cody didn’t mind, apparently his thousand credit bet from before had been taken by no less than fifty people on Midway so he was over fifty thousand credits richer.\n\n“Tendaya, this is Midway,” Steve Ahmet replied cheerfully. “Good to hear you! It’s been rather boring this past week. We’re activating Beacon Three for you, you should see it presently.”\n\n“Excellent,” Don Hartman replied. “Course set, en route, ETA three hours.”\n\n“That’s quick,” Nora said, looking around for the nearest workstation and tapping in some commands. “Wow, these Tendayas are nice.”\n\n#\n\nThe Tendaya looked bigger than their old Phoenix-class lightships. It had four shuttles, two ECLSS units and two AMCs for greater range. Also someone had painted the tops of the connecting tubes green, making the ship look more festive than the older ones.\n\n“Captain!” Cody said, shaking Don Hartman’s hand gladly when he excited the docking tube. “Who did you bribe for this?”\n\n“No one,” Hartman replied. “I just pointed out that I had the most command time with the Phoenix-class ships and so it made sense to let me run the trials.”\n\nCody indicated for the other to follow him as he turned back toward the corridors that would lead them to Briefing One. “And Percy?”\n\n“I sent him on to Deneb with the good news,” Hartman replied. “Also he’s now Commodore Leyton, commanding not just Hermes but three of the Tendayas.” His expression changed as he said, “How soon can you be ready?”\n\n“For what?”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["epub", "qa", "v1"]}

She shook herself. “Well, enough whining, it’s time to —”\n\nAndrea’s phone rang.

She listened silently for a moment and then she turned angry. “Now, listen here! You are in violation of The Hate Crimes Act and we will prosecute you to the fullest extent of the law!” She slammed the phone down and sat back in her chair, her chest heaving with fury. When she calmed herself, she turned to LaReyna as if nothing had happened. “You were saying?”\n\n“I’ll set up a filter,” LaReyna said. “All threats will be sent to a dedicated system, cataloged, targeted, and filed by level of severity.”\n\n“None of which will do any good because you’re not human,” Andrea reminded her.\n\n“We’ve got enough money to make life difficult for some people,” LaReyna replied. Andrea looked at her in alarm, so LaReyna raised a hand in a soothing gesture, and hastily added, “Legally.”\n\nShe said something under her breath which Andrea didn’t catch. “Pardon?”\n\n“I said we may as well enjoy it while we have it,” LaReyna told her.

I know this story!” I said, jumping out of my bed and going to my bookshelf. “I know how it ends!” I pulled my book of fairy tables off the shelf, opened it and rifled through to the story.\n\nYou do? the book cried excitedly. Will you read it to me?\n\nI stopped, looking down at the pages. I shook my head. “I don’t think you want to know.”\n\nBut I’ve never been told a story before, the book pleaded.\n\n“It doesn’t have a happy ending,” I warned.\n\nPlease! I’ll — just, please!\n\n“Okay,” I said. “But you’ve been warned.” So I read Hansel and Gretel out loud to the book without end.\n\nWhen I was finished, the book was silent for a long, long while. Finally, it wailed, Nooo!!\n\n“I’m sorry,” I told it.\n\nShe died, the book said. I feared as much. It was silent a moment longer. Then, At least she found peace in the end.\n\nWell, I don’t think being burned alive in an oven was much in the way of peace but I suppose… given everything she’d been through, at least it was an end to her suffering.\n\n“She was really only ten?” I said.\n\nAll witches are younger than they look, the book said. It takes power to make a spell come true. Age.\n\n“The book with the spell, that was you?” I said out loud. Okay, I was ready to believe that a book really could talk to me.

The big man grinning at me was one I knew very well. I’d seen him in countless movies and TV shows. He was one of the most famous actors in Hollywood. And, once I saw that, I could see it reflected in Tiffany, too. She was definitely his daughter. His smile was infectious. He reached a hand back to grab Tiffany’s and gave it a quick squeeze. And then — surprise — he offered it to me. I took it for just a second. I’d just touched hands with one of the most famous people in the whole world!\n\nWhat’s his real name? I’m not telling. As far as you’ll ever know, he’s just Tiffany’s dad.\n\nHe pulled out into traffic and drove down the avenue for a while before turning into a cul-de-sac. At the end of it, he toggled a button on the remote and the dead end twitched and disappeared. He continued driving as the SUV dipped down and went underground. Five minutes later, we stopped at an underground parking lot.\n\n“Hoods,” Mr. Creek said as we got out of the car. “I’m sorry.”\n\n“It’s standard procedure,” Tiffany whispered to me as the bodyguard handed her a black hood. She pulled it over her head. The bodyguard handed me one, too. I pulled it on.\n\nHands gently pushed on my back, guiding my steps. I stumbled once and Mr. Creek, mumbled, “Sorry.”\n\nI don’t know quite how long we walked before we finally stopped — maybe five minutes? Long enough that I couldn’t say precisely where we were. And, I guess that was the point.\n\n“You can take yours off, now,” Tiffany said, her voice unmuffled. I pulled the hood off and saw that she was standing in front of me, looking apologetic. “Sorry, but —”\n\nI held up a hand. “That was cool!” I said. I glanced toward Mr. Creek. “Are you a spy?”\n\nHe laughed, a deep rumbling laugh, and shook his head.\n\n“No,” Tiffany said with a laugh of her own. But it was fake.

Tiffany pulled me along so fast that I had to trot to keep up.\n\nShe pulled me into a huge room. It had a california king bed in the middle but there was a wide door leading into a bathroom and another door leading into one of the biggest walk-in closets that I’d ever seen. There were stuffed animals all over the place and a three-screen computer on a desk, a wall screen display with all the games consoles hooked up. It was a princess’ room. But, of course, Tiffany looked like a princess.\n\nOnly now, she was eyeing me nervously. Like she was worried about what I’d say. I squeezed her hand and said, “Wow!”\n\n“Yeah, I know, it’s kinda gross,” Tiffany said.\n\nI shook my head. “No! It’s just… well, to be honest, it’s sort of what I thought you were like.”\n\n“Rich and spoiled?” Tiffany asked.\n\nReluctantly, I nodded. “But you’re —”\n\n“I am,” she cut in. “Rich and spoiled.”\n\n“No,” I told her. “Rich, yes. Spoiled, no.” Something in Tiffany’s eyes changed. She looked relieved. She waved a hand around the room. “So, what do you want to do?”\n\n“What do you want to do?” I asked her. “I mean, we could just sit and talk.”\n\n“Or we could do makeup,” Tiffany said, gesturing to another part of her room which was fitted out with a full makeup bar. “I had the staff get some for your skin tones.”\n\nWell, Tiffany was much darker than me, so that made sense. But…\n\nTiffany’s eyes narrowed. “When’s the last time you got made up?”\n\nI started to answer but could only shake my head. “I’m not really into that sort of stuff.”\n\n“That’s because you’ve never tried!” Tiffany said, guiding me toward the makeup chair. “I’ve practiced on Wanda —” she broke off for a moment, then brightened “— but your skin color is much cooler!”\n\nSo I let myself be made up.

A wiry seaman came rushing forward.\n\n“I need you to follow the Captain O’Hara’s orders,” I said to the carpenter. To Captain MacArdle, I said, “We’ll arm Lightning and fight.”\n\n“What good will that do?” Captain MacArdle demanded. “They can attack from any quarter!”\n\n“So can we,” I told him, pointing to my walker. “Lightning can turn to bear wherever we need.”\n\n“What sort of gun are you considering?” Captain O’Hara asked, eyeing the lumpy canvas covering the walker dubiously.\n\n“We’ll need all the range we can get,” Captain MacArdle told him.\n\n“Then you’ll want either a long nine or the eighteen pounder.”\n\n“Take the eighteen pounder,” I said.\n\n“That gun will be too heavy.”\n\n“We’ll see,” I said, turning my back on him and moving toward Lightning. I ordered the soldiers to help me pull off the canvas.\n\n“Wait!” Captain MacArdle said. I paused and looked back at him as he ordered two sailors to grab rope. “Let’s keep our surprise from the enemy until we’re ready.”\n\n“Good idea!” Captain O’Hara agreed emphatically. “At the very least,” he said to me in an undertone, “we can keep the British from seeing the walker before we send it overboard.”\n\nI growled at him and he glared back. “Get with the carpenter,” I told him. He took a breath and turned away, struggling to bring his feelings under control.\n\nThe next hour was a feverish blur of activity, frustration, exhilaration and worry.\n\nIt took longer to lift Lightning up with cables and winches than I’d feared and, once up, I had the devil of a time getting the fires to start. I had the cook bring up boiling tubs of fresh water and poured them into the boiler to speed things up. In the meantime, below me, Captain O’Hara, the carpenter, and two sailors hammered and sawed to build the mount for the eighteen pounder.\n\n“It’s ready,” O’Hara called moments before I had enough steam, “now what?”\n\n“We mount the gun, of course,” I said, startled at his tone.\n\n“How?” he asked."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["epub", "qa", "v1"]}

She dragged me back to the lockers and peeled out of her stuff, letting me get into it, all the while keeping up a running monologue about her match. I smiled and concentrated on gearing up. In a short while we were back out, just in time to see Wanda’s first match. She didn’t win. But she was happy all the same. She and Tiffany giggled as they rushed to the lockers to get Tiffany changed.\n\n“Next up, Holly McNee from École Erasmus and Ginny Dover from Westlake,” the ref called.

Finally, I lunged. I hit her chest just below her heart.\n\n“Point, McNee,” the judge called.\n\nThe match was over, I’d won. I stepped back and saluted. Ginny did the same. And then we moved off the mat. Ginny raised her helmet and smiled at me. “Good work!”\n\n“Thanks!” I said.\n\n“I’ve never fenced a lefty before,” she admitted. She smiled at me. “But I’ll know better next time.”\n\n“You’ve got the reach,” I said to her.\n\n“You had the skill,” she said to me with a smile.\n\nBecause I’d won, I was told to stand by for the playoffs.

It was PE, Physical Education, all the way across campus and downhill in the Arts & Athletics building. Our gym teacher was Miss Phillips. She was young, fit, and extremely cheerful. She ran through the roll and gave us all sad looks as she noticed that we weren’t in our gym clothes. She showed us our gym lockers and cheered on everyone who had brought their clothes in their backpacks.\n\nI wasn’t one of them. Tiffany was. So were her posse. So while I stood in the cold gym, they and the others who had their clothes, changed in the locker room.\n\n“Those of you who don’t have proper clothes will have until next week,” Miss Phillips told us. “Today we’re going to do stretching exercises so you won’t get too sweaty.” She wrinkled her nose. “Or smelly.”\n\nThe boys in our class snickered. Except for Brian who stood silently, dressed in his perfectly creased gym uniform like some military cadet assigned to the wrong unit. Brian was buff. His dad was a fitness instructor and Brian was thrilled to work out with him regularly. Brian was also big into martial arts which was going to come as a surprise to most of the class.\n\nI’d trained with Brian when we were younger but I’d given it up… well, because we couldn’t afford it. Brian was silent for a week when I’d stopped but I couldn’t tell him why. Because if he asked my mother, she’d go all red, silent and sad. Or she’d sell a kidney to pay for my lessons. The only reason we would afford Erasmus was because of a scholarship. We’d been planning for me to go to public school until one day in the mail we got this letter from Erasmus. The scholarship was from an anonymous donor. It wasn’t quite like an owl delivered an invite but it was awfully close. For a couple of days I wondered if Erasmus wasn’t really a school of witchcraft pretending to be a normal school to blend in.\n\nAnyway, Brian sidled over to me and bowed formally.

The slight motion was buried in the seismograph and imperceptible under all the rapid motion of the ground display.\n\n“S-wave,” Ryan said, pointing as the ground around Northridge’s green dart started rippling up and down. He blew out a breath and pointed toward the seismograph, which was nothing more than a jagged blotch of tightly-spaced squiggled lines.\n\nAnd then everything was moving, as the ripples from the various earthquakes merged and added their power to create huge movements in the ground display.\n\n“Altogether there’s over thirty minutes of continuous motion,” Ryan said as the seismograph’s needle slowly stopped its maniac quivering and began to settle down.

With a sound between a growl and a sigh, she rose from her chair and marched to the whiteboard. At the very top she’d optimistically put the headings: Patents Applied For; Patents Pending; Patents Received. The numbers were supposed to march from left to right as more and more patents were received, building LAInet’s portfolio into a billion-dollar powerhouse. But she’d had to add two more columns: Patents Contested and Patents Rejected. And now, with an angry swipe of the eraser, she wiped the entire table from the board.\n\nAt one point they’d had thirty patents approved; now she’d just been told that yet another had been rejected and she just couldn’t bring herself to erase the paltry “4” and replace it with an even more pitiable “3.”\n\nThe door to her office opened slightly and a head peeked around.

As of now, LAInet had thirty-four employees, if one included LaReyna.

There was debris around it — metal girders, bits of smashed ships and building materials — which Clive navigated easily.\n\n“We’ve got an airlock!” Clive cried triumphantly. “I’m banging on it.”\n\nA moment later the flashing light went out.\n\n“What’s going on?” Jasmine asked. “Why aren’t —”\n\n“This is weird,” Clive said. “Captain, can you do a thermal scan?”\n\n“You’re in the way,” Cody warned. “All I’d get is your suits.”\n\n“Right, backing up,” Clive said.\n\nA moment later, Cody fired up the sensors in infrared, looking for warm spots. “Okay,” Cody said. “I’ve got a number of small spots, nothing major but —” he broke off and turned to Ellaz “— I think they’re kids.”\n\n“Kids?” Clive said. “Okay, we’re going in.”\n\n“I need to go to them,” Ellaz said, unbuckling herself. “They’re going to need me.”\n\n“Why?” Cody said.\n\n“Those are kids,” Ellaz said. “I’m a kid. They’ll need me to talk with them.”\n\nCody frowned. “Have you ever talked to kids?”\n\n“Sure, loads of times!” Ellaz swore. Cody gave her a look. “Well, no,” Ellaz said, “but they’re at the spaceport which means either they worked there —”\n\n“Not likely,” Edie interjected.\n\n“Or they were on a tour,” Ellaz finished. “Which means they are interested in construction —”\n\n“What’s that got to do with you going there?”\n\n“Skills assessment,” Ellaz said, putting on her helmet and walking into the airlock.\n\n“And none of us can do that?” Clive Bamber demanded.\n\n“Probably,” Ellaz said, “but I’ll be quicker.”\n\nCody shook his head. The girl was so conceited.\n\n“We’re going in,” Clive said. “You can come when we’ve cleared the area.”\n\n“Of course,” Ellaz agreed. “There’s no point in me risking my life.”\n\n“Is she always like this?” Jasmine Crump asked, bustling up to the cockpit and dropping into the co-pilot’s seat.

I got up, saying, “Excuse me.” As I left, I gave Jamie a meaningful nod.\n\nI raced out of the dining room and nearly collided with Bessie. “What?”\n\n“The food’s ready, miss, what do I do? Your father raced off and he’s not back yet.”\n\n“Where’s Mary?” I asked, looking around.\n\n“She’s tending the pots,” Bessie said. “We can’t wait too much longer or things will burn.”\n\n“Have you a soup?”\n\n“Of course, miss.”\n\n“Well serve that up, along with some wine,” I said.\n\n“Ah, but miss, that’s the problem,” Bessie wailed. I gave her a look which must have been quite frightening for she took a step back. “Your father keeps the key to the wine, you know that, miss.”\n\n“Oh!” I’d quite forgotten, wine never being something that attracted my attention.\n\n“Well, start with water and the soup,” I said. “Father should be back before long.”\n\nBessie dipped her head in acknowledgement and trotted back to the kitchen.\n\nI returned to the dining room, did a quick count of settings and realized we were two short. I rushed to Jamie and whispered in his ear, “You’re not hungry.”\n\nHe gave me a startled look and I added, “Nor am I.” He glanced down the table, followed my logic and nodded glumly.\n\n“Sirs,” I said, nodding to all around the table, “my brother and I will wait our dinner for our father’s return but we’re certain he wouldn’t want you to wait any longer.” I gestured toward the kitchen. “We’ll be serving soup for starters, please be seated.”\n\nThere were hearty denials from all around until I said, “I’m certain that father would want it thus, gentlemen and, besides, the soup would get cold.” I paused for a moment before adding, “And our Bessie did go to such efforts to get it just right.”\n\n“Well, then I suppose we can’t say no,” Lieutenant Anderson agreed gallantly. “And my compliments to your marvelous Bessie.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["epub", "summary", "v1"]}

And then, “Can I pet your cat?”\n\nOf course, it didn’t take long for all three Miller girls to start petting Caerus. Caerus was more than thrilled at the attention. Which meant that, before too long, Mr. Miller was over at the bleachers.\n\n“You’ve got a cat?” Mr. Miller said to Jasmine.\n\n“Can I get one, Daddy?” Ivy said. “Holly said we had to wait to ask you.”\n\n“Me too!” “Me too!” The two other Millers added.\n\nMr. Miller gave me a look. “I don’t think that Holly —”\n\n“Oh, it’s no problem,” I said. “I’ve got lots.”\n\n“Yeah, lots!” Little Pearl added enthusiastically. “She tried to give one to that man but he left.”\n\n“Man?” Mr. Miller said, raising an eyebrow to me.\n\n“Someone from the shop,” I said. “Dad knows him.”\n\n“Huh,” Mr. Miller grunted. He turned to his girls. “But, sweeties, I don’t think we can manage too many cats.”\n\nI glanced to Anna. And then I heard a voice. It was Tiffany. I waved her over. She came up the bleachers and sat on the other side of me, nodding to Mr. Miller.\n\n“The girls want cats,” I explained to her.\n\nTiffany’s eyes got big. “Did you tell them —?”\n\nI shook my head.\n\n“Tell them what?” Mr. Miller asked suspiciously.\n\n“Um,” I said, “they’re special cats, Mr. Miller. More special than usual.”\n\n“Well, we’ll have to think about it, then,” Mr. Miller allowed. He nodded to his kids. “Come on, girls, you can help out.”\n\nThe girls shot him rebellious looks but didn’t argue, following along behind him with backwards glances — pleading glances — my way.\n\n“You can’t just go around telling everyone about magic,” Anna said to me when they were out of earshot.\n\n“Yeah…,” I began, then, “Why not?”\n\n“What?”\n\n“Well, who’s going to believe me?” I said.\n\n“Not Mr. Lucks, that’s for certain!” Anna said.\n\n“But Ivy, Pearl, and Jade, they would,” I said.\n\n“But they don’t know what it means,” Anna said.\n\n“What does it mean?” I asked.

I couldn’t move fast. I felt like I was stumbling and would collapse again at any moment. But the smells from the house, the fresh bread, the ginger… they wafted me on. I broke off a mouthful of my door and gobbled it down eagerly. But my stomach was still empty, aching. And now I had a nick in my door.\n\nInside, the house was every bit as brilliant as I’d hoped. Chairs made of candy sat around a table made of solid sugar. The colors were delightful. I didn’t need a mirror, the smooth surface of the table — no! No, that was wrong! The table —\n\nI went to the other rooms, found the bedroom and the dresser. There! There was a proper mirror! I looked into it and… I was ugly! I was old, stooped! I had warts. Even my eyes looked old and nasty.\n\nEverything has a price.\n\nA price! If I paid the price, I could be young again! I was only ten but I looked like eighty! How could I… what price would be needed to get back my youth?\n\nAnd then I knew. I knew the price I had to pay. And I smiled to myself. Wasn’t I living in the perfect place? I could pay the price without fear.\n\nI went back into the kitchen, put my book on the mirror-smooth table and began to write…\n\nI woke up, sitting bolt upright in my bed, my heart pounding, my back sweaty.\n\nThat was the last time she wrote in me, the book thought.\n\n“What?” I said aloud.\n\nThat was the last time she wrote in me, the book repeated sadly. The next time, it was someone else. I never knew what happened to her, poor little girl.\n\n“She was going to eat children to make herself young again,” I said when I finally could keep my stomach from heaving. “She was horrible, evil.”\n\nShe was starving, miserable, the book said.

She sighed and found a parking spot, pulled into it and got out of her car. She waved at the teacher on duty and made her way to the back and the playground where the kids loitered at the end of the school day.\n\n“Mrs. Moore!” Nancy Day, the school’s principal and resident nurse, cried in relief when she spotted Susan. “Janey’s in the office. She’s not doing well.”\n\nSusan followed her as she led the way inside one of the converted houses to the principal’s office. Just outside of it was another room with seats and cots. Janey was lying down on a cot, her eyes closed.\n\n“Janey?” Susan said as she knelt beside her daughter. “What’s up, sweetie?”\n\n“She’s not the only one today,” Nancy said. Susan shot her a look and the other woman shrugged. “Ever since the funeral —”\n\nJaney’s eyes opened and she grabbed at her mother. “You’re alive!”\n\n“Of course I am!” Susan said, hugging her little girl tight.\n\n“Ellay didn’t come,” Janey said. “They say they killed her when they killed her big sister but… they really did.”\n\n“Yes, sweetie, I’m sorry,” Susan said.

Fortunately, father had flung himself to one side so he landed beside, rather than on top of, me.\n\nAbove us, like a malevolent demon, the steam from the boiler hissed and spewed up into the clear sky as though the steam was racing to join the clouds above.\n\n“Are ye alright, Danni,” father asked as he rolled over and sat up.\n\n“Yes sir,” I told him as I looked myself over.\n\n“Live steam like that is dangerous,” father said in answer to my unspoken question. “Better to be far away than scalded.”\n\nI nodded; I’d enough burns from pouring molten metal to readily imagine the dangers of steam at such pressures.\n\nThe sound of hooves clattered on the damp soil alerted us to the approaching rider and father shot to his feet to wave and shout, “Stay clear!”\n\n“Are you all right?” the rider called back.

He raised the gravity to a sixth gee — the same as old Earth’s moon.\n\nThen he pulled out a hand scanner and ran it over her from top to bottom.

If the Yellowstone supervolcano erupted — when it erupted — it would affect everything from Washington State in the Northwest to Mississippi in the Southeast. Most of the United States would be affected, if by nothing more than large amounts of dense volcanic ash. The good news — if it were possible to consider good news — would be that the ash would drop the global temperatures worldwide by ten degrees. “Global warming” would cease overnight. Whether it was an “Extinction Level Event” — like the asteroid that killed the dinosaurs — was an open question. Deke wanted to answer that question. This run at the Aurora supercomputer would have helped.\n\nDeke glanced around his office to make sure that there was no one there, then he typed in a couple of quick commands.

Except… strangely, Mr. Herald ran a gym. He taught the people who taught movie stars. And… well, he was a sweetie. A big, sometimes very scary, teddy bear.\n\n“Yeah,” Tiff snorted, “you keep saying that, computerhead.” She rushed ahead of us.\n\nBrian looked stumped.

He glanced toward the steam engine and the boiler. “How well will they handle a tossing?”\n\nWe’d discussed this when we’d first designed the naval version of my steam engines. On a ship it was quite possible that it would rock and roll in excess of thirty degrees from side to side, up and down, so we designed the fire box to be fully enclosed and sealable with air only entering through the bottom at the grate. I was pretty sure that would hold, although I wasn’t sure how the boiler would handle being sloshed about. The engine itself was probably in no danger but the same couldn’t be said for the pair of paddle wheels which descended amidships into the sea. Nor, come to think of it, had we considered what might happen if one of the paddles were completely immersed in water — they depended upon being partly out of water at the top to work.\n\n“Maybe we should have put the engine in the mid-deck,” I said after a long moment. It had been my original suggestion but all three sailors had rejected it, fearing the increased risk of fire and also citing the extra work required to set in the paddle wheels. Now, though, the danger that the boiler or the engine might be swamped made my original suggestion to place it under cover far more cogent.\n\n“We could stop the wheels and pull them up,” Captain MacArdle said thoughtfully, peering forward as if imagining the work.\n\n“That would be difficult.”\n\n“And more of a problem if something broke,” he agreed.\n\nI nodded to show that I’d heard.

Georgia nodded. “So why not just have the NSA guys close them down and hoover out this AI?”\n\n“Oh, come on, Cole, you can’t believe that the damned thing is still local, can you?” Stephens asked derisively. “Whatever it is has gone, flown the coop.” He shook his head and said to Georgia, “You’d just be locking the barn door after the horse has escaped.”\n\n“The thing’s a helluva lot smarter than a horse,” Jones muttered.\n\n“Whether the AI is here or not, is not as important as considering its birth,” Father Lawson said. “Knowing how it was created will give us a better chance of anticipating its actions and locating it.”\n\n“And help you decide whether or not to kill it,” Dr. Stephens said darkly, frowning at Georgia. “Don’t think I didn’t read your dissertation carefully before coming in here.”\n\n“Kill it?” Dr. Marshall looked from Georgia to Stephens and back. “You can’t be serious?” When he caught her expression, he added hastily, “That’s insane! Consider what it means, what it can do—”\n\n“I have,” Georgia cut across him. She glanced at the CalTech head. “Dr. Stephens, you know that in my dissertation I emphasized that initial conditions will predict outcomes—”\n\n“Some blather about a baby AI needing to grow up in a nurturing environment,” Stephens said in an aside to Marshall, before saying to Georgia, “Mediocre at the best which is why you’re here, I expect.” He turned again to Marshall as he added, “Now, Ryan’s work was worth reading, some seminal stuff in there. If I’d been head when he was here, I’d’ve kept him on staff.”\n\n“He was at CalTech yesterday,” Georgia said, ignoring the professor’s jab.\n\n“He was?”\n\n“Visiting the Seismology laboratory,” Georgia told him. “He had a full staff meeting there.”\n\n“Well, that’s not my department.”\n\nGeorgia nodded, then said, “Regardless, professors, I’d like you two to tackle—alone or in conjunction—the possible first-light scenarios with particular attention to compute power, alternate input sources, and coding efforts. Once you’ve done that, Mr. Jones here will work with Mr. Davis to compare your data with the capabilities in the area.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["epub", "summary", "v1"]}

It would mean flying at a slight angle relative to their original course, so that they arrived at the same location rather than some distance above it.\n\nAnd when we get there?

If there are aliens.\n\nThey used a lance, Cody thought even as he said out loud, “We’re okay! Stand down! We had to dodge a clump, that’s all.”\n\n“Thanks for the update,” Nora replied, sounding both relieved and a bit tetchy at the late report.\n\nCould we make our bow into a lance? Cody thought to Ellaz.\n\nHe could feel her smile as she thought, File Twelve.\n\nCody pulled up File Twelve and “read” through it quickly. Yeah, this could work.\n\nBut we won’t know until we try it, Ellaz added.\n\nAnd we shouldn’t try it without a target, Cody agreed. Without a target — something to hit — the warp lance might be more than a little dangerous to Hope herself. Cody glanced at their forward display and frowned. How come the monitor didn’t —?\n\nI may have missed it, Ellaz told him. Sorry.\n\nCody waved off her apology. He thought for a moment. Is there a way to deflect a warp? Like shield or a mirror?\n\nA warp mirror? Ellaz repeated thoughtfully. No one’s ever tried. The math alone — she broke off, then added more enthusiastically — Cody, let’s do the math!\n\nCody frowned and then his expression changed as all around them there appeared the mathematical equations that described their warp bubble. He pointed to some terms, copied them, squeezed them with his mental “hands” and showed how they could create a warp lance.\n\nAnd if we could squeeze a bit off — Ellaz said, grabbing the equations eagerly and manipulating them — we could make a warp dart!\n\nI like that!

Oh, there were some differences and some of them were a bit alarming, but Ryan became convinced once more that LaReyna had it more right than anyone.\n\nShe’d been killed before she could complete the job. What they knew was only enough to predict areas, not individual buildings, let alone separate rooms or floors.\n\nIt wasn’t enough to say that everyone in Whittier needed to evacuate. And, Ryan knew from what little he could get out of the mainframes at work, there were whole areas—particularly in Santa Monica itself and over in Sherman Oaks—where they hadn’t even begun to make predictions.\n\nSanta Monica had suffered in the Northridge quake of 1994 because of reflected energies, while Sherman Oaks and Encino had both taken serious damage because they were built on liquefaction zones—places where the ground would turn to mud in an earthquake, swallowing cars and even buildings like quicksand.\n\nMerry Christmas, Ryan thought to himself.

And Tilly’s harsh recovery — and injuries — had moved even Ellaz to forgive her a lot. Even mass murder.\n\nDr. Noran had given Cody a head’s-up on that — she’d taken a personal involvement in Tilly’s case and was now Tristan’s Chief Medical Officer — Commander Noran. Tristan had a full state-of-the-art twelve bay medical section, with specialists in pediatrics and replicator systems.\n\nTristan also had a half battalion of ex-Quark Marines, commanded by Colonel Alistair Hutchinson. The marines had “just happened” to be drilling when Cody scheduled his EVA with Tilly, so that they “just managed” to form a protective corridor around their commander-in-chief and one of their newest recruits.\n\n“They’re not overdue for another week,” Nora said, coming up behind them and waving a hand to Tilly, who grinned back.

She raised her right arm and eyed it. “Like I build a Portal in my arm?”\n\n“It would not be a Portal,” Zeus said. “It is a variant on the Affinity spell.”\n\n“Affinity spell?” I repeated.\n\n“Which is,” Zeus continued slowly, “related to a Portal.”\n\n“But much more complicated,” I guessed.\n\n“Indeed,” Zeus agreed. “Particularly as Portal connects one place to another while an Affinity spell connects one person to one object.”\n\n“Where does the object go?” Tiffany asked.\n\n“Into you,” Zeus said. “Holly’s sword is a part of her.” He waited for Tiffany’s reaction before adding, “Which is why the Affinity is usually associated with a bone.

But, then again, I’d never tried talking with trees before.\n\n“Now!” Brian said. He spoke the words, threw the spark, and the eight pegs burst forth with flame, the twine caught and we found ourselves in the center of a burning circle. His voice changed tone and we followed, word for word as we said the spell of Opening.\n\nLightning sparked overhead in a great, loud, boom! The sky lit up and then the ground beneath us shook. We stumbled back, moving to each other as the ground rumbled and a lightning bolt struck the tree just in front of us.\n\nWe were blinded. When the image of the lightning faded from our eyes, we saw that the tree had been blasted.\n\n“Quickly!” I shouted, “We don’t have much time!” I raced forward, into the opening and the glowing light that rose up below.\n\n“Three minutes!” Tiffany shouted, just behind me.\n\nI raced down a long line of stone stairs, cut into the earth but smoking as though they had been freshly made.\n\nMade by our magic.\n\nWe reached level ground and the others spread out around me. We were in a huge cavern — the one from our dreams — and sitting just beside us was —\n\n“Hermes!” I cried, rushing over to the white cat who sat there grooming himself. He looked up at me and then turned to stare ahead.\n\nJust as a huge, echoing sound boomed in front of us. I turned from Hermes and —\n\nAll I saw were the eyes. Huge, glowing, fierce, red eyes.\n\nSome sense I didn’t know I had caused me to bow. “Zeus.”\n\n“Girl,” Zeus boomed. “Are you ready to meet your doom?”\n\nI straightened up and looked over to Tiffany. She gave me a wan smile and little wave of her hand, ‘All yours.’\n\n“No,” I said, moving over to grab Tiffany’s hand. Beyond her, I saw Brian and Natasha, holding hands and forming a human chain. “We are not.” And then, I pulled on all the strength I could. “Are you?”\n\nA huge rumbling shook the cavern as Zeus roared with laughter."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["epub", "continuation", "v1"]}

However, because we’re all new to each other, I think we should start by getting to know who we are.” He paused. And then smiled. Next to me, Anna sat up straighter. “So… you’re going to write me an essay. ‘Who I am and Who I want to be.’ First, we’ll talk about what I expect to see in this work.”\n\nHe gave us a quick rundown which filled up the rest of the class. I jumped when the bell rang and he shooed us out, saying, “You’ll turn these in tomorrow and I’ll be excited to read them!”\n\nOutside, Tiffany looked at me and said, “Oh, wow!”\n\n“Is that your Dad?” Wanda Bee demanded as she strode up to us. “He’s awfully mean, isn’t he? I mean, the first day and we’ve got more homework!”\n\nShe rushed on by, but not before glancing suspiciously at Anna and hopefully at Tiffany and Nat.\n\nAnna followed us to the next class, looking a bit lost. Tiffany and Nat gave me looks, like I was expected to know what to do. I mean — she was our teacher! And now, she was just a regular old twelve year-old. Witch. A twelve year-old witch who’d been… I dunno, like forty just yesterday! And she’d been teaching English for over a dozen years!\n\n“Is this going to be easy for you?” I said to Anna as we found seats in Science class. “I mean, the essay?”\n\nAnna shook her head. Tiffany looked at her in surprise. “Think about it,” Anna said to her, “what am I going to write?”\n\nTiffany’s eyes went wide and she gave Anna a sympathetic look. Then, she proved to me that she was one of the coolest people on the planet, saying, “We’ll help.”\n\n“Yeah, we will,” Natasha and I chimed in unison.

No cars hit me. Drat. I mean, a simple accident, something! And then I wouldn’t have had to go to school with the Zit Of Shame.\n\nI locked up my bike and started toward class. Mr. Mallory spotted me and did a double take. He came over and eyed me. Like that wasn’t weird.\n\n“Oh!” He apologized. “I was afraid —”\n\n“Thanks,” I told him. “I’m fine.”\n\n“Well, you’re at the age when skin acts up,” Mr. Mallory told me philosophically. “Best get to class.”\n\nI nodded and moved off, turning my head back once to look at him.

But by then I didn’t care.\n\n“Hey, who’s that?” Tiffany cried pointing to me and waving to her friends. “Holly’s got a new friend!”\n\n“Where?” Wanda asked. She was good at playing dumb. I wasn’t too sure how much of it was an act, honestly.\n\n“Right there!” Tiffany said, pointing straight at my zit. “Hey, Holly, aren’t you going to introduce us?”\n\nI tried ignoring her.

She looked at him, considered it and nodded. “Unless they’ve got an atmosphere —” he broke off and rushed to the cockpit.\n\n“What?” Ellaz called after him.\n\n“Scanning!” Cody called back. “Come up here and run thermal, if you want to help!”\n\nEllaz looked around the cabin. “Can’t!” Too many of the kids needed her, needed the medpacks, needed… to live.\n\n#\n\nTwo hours — and one miraculous rescue of five spacers trapped in an airlock later — they turned back to the farthest moon and DS1.\n\nFortunately, the five were older and able to look after the youngsters.

She closed her eyes and was asleep before Cody had finished talking.\n\nThey made their way back at one gee, relative. Because the thrust was from the rear, the cockpit was “higher” than the main cabin, so no one came forward. Cody set up more searches, just in case, but he was afraid that the chances were too low.\n\n“Deep Space One, this is Wasp, twenty-three souls on board,” Cody radioed. “Returning to base.”\n\nThe reply took over two minutes to get back. “Roger, Wasp.

Then I heard a chair squeak and looked toward the sound. Tiffany. She looked miserable. Did her parents find out? Get mad? Who would have… Wanda entered, sitting in the back. Natasha entered a few moments later, shot a look at Tiffany and went back to join Wanda. They were both sitting where they shouldn’t but Mrs. Balfour merely said, “Tardy slips, you two. Collect them after class.”\n\nWanda and Natasha looked like they didn’t care. Wanda murmured something that sounded like, “Art class.”\n\nWait a minute! Wanda and Natasha knew about Tiffany’s ‘extra credit.’ Did one of them tell her parents? I turned to glance back at them. Wanda noticed and waggled her fingers at me, smirking.\n\nWho would want friends like that? I wondered. From the look Tiffany was giving them, she did.\n\n* * *\n\nLunch. At my tree. Quick eat, quick read. Back to classes. Music this afternoon. I was in chorus. I couldn’t really sing but I couldn’t play an instrument, either, so… chorus it was. We were just warming up when Dean Harte opened the door. Mr. Miller was behind him, dressed… oddly.\n\nDean Harte caught Miss Sharpe’s attention and she turned to them. Dean Harte rushed over to her and whispered in her ear. Miss Sharpe looked at him, looked at Mr. Miller and whispered back, clearly peeved. She lost the argument and turned to us. “Class, the Dean would like your attention.\n\nDean Harte moved forward. “Students, I’d like to introduce you to our new Fencing Master,” he said. “As you know, Erasmus has an award-winning tradition in fencing, with some of our fencers going on to compete — and win! — in the Olympics.\n\n“Up until now, sixth graders were not allowed to participate,” the Dean continued. “But the Principal has made an exception this year.” He nodded to Mr. Miller. “Mr. Miller has kindly consented to lead our team — he was an Olympic medallist — and has compiled a list over the past week of possibilities.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["epub", "paraphrase", "v1"]}

I had less than seventeen days to find seven more witches. Do you know how hard it is to find a witch? I mean, yeah, I’d ‘found’ twenty-three but a lot of those were from beforehand and the others were like, all parents. The biggest hit we’d had was the Millers. And it’s not like you can take out an ad in the papers. Or post up on the internet. (In fact, don’t try. You will get some truly scary replies, believe me. Or ask Wanda.)\n\nThird period we had Religion. Only when we got to the special class, I found not only Jasmine Nadi but also Mr. Miller and Mr. Lucks. Mrs. Belle hustled us in quickly when she arrived, plunking her bag on the table with a very heavy-sounding clunk.\n\n“For the sake of efficiency, I’ve arranged for Mr. Miller to help out with teaching,” Mrs. Belle said. “And I’ve asked Mr. Lucks here to introduce him to Erich.” With that, she opened her bag and pulled out the book.\n\nExcept it looked nothing like the book I’d seen that first day back in the library.\n\n“It’s got fat!” Wanda declared when she looked at it.\n\n“It appears to expand when necessary,” Mrs. Belle said in agreement. She cocked an eye at Mr. Lucks. “Didn’t you say that you read Latin and Greek?”\n\n“Ancient Greek,” Mr. Lucks said. He eyed the book warily. “Is there Ancient Greek there?”\n\n“More than I can handle,” Mrs. Belle admitted. “I’ve been tackling the Sanskrit but I think there’s another language before it which I can’t read.”\n\n“Why do you think that, Tilly?” Mr. Miller asked.\n\n“Because the Sanskrit seems to start about three hundred pages in,” Mrs. Belle replied. “And it’s Vedic Sanskrit, not Classical.”\n\nMr. Miller whistled. “If the words were written into the book at the time the language was spoken, that makes this book at least three thousand years old.”\n\n“But,” I said, quickly, “Erich’s not that old!”\n\n“Yes,” Mrs. Belle agreed. “The book predates Erich by quite some time.”\n\n“So, who created the book first?” Nat asked.\n\n“And why?” Tiffany added."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["epub", "paraphrase", "v1"]}

He glanced around, frowned, and said, “What about the tree?”\n\n“The tree!” I cried rushing out the door.

Heather Rourke was out today. She was sick a lot. No one quite knew why because no one quite knew her. She seemed nice enough. She didn’t have any friends at school and always looked… well, furtive. Like she was hiding something.\n\nI gathered my things and did the walk of shame as the whole class ooh!ed at me, dropping into Heather’s seat and keeping my head down. I put my backpack on the floor and reached for my notebook when I noticed something on the underside of the desk. A yellow Post It note. I frowned at it. It practically fell into my hand before I considered taking it.\n\nI looked down at it. There was one word written on it.

And then, to make that real, he shut down their active systems.\n\n“Holy shit!” Ellaz cried, pointing behind them. “They got everything!”\n\nCody followed her finger with his head and his jaw dropped.\n\nThe freighter Hornet was docked at Parminter Station Number One, the largest of four orbiting cargo stations for the planet Meath.

Judge Hill kept her expression neutral as she realized who was really in charge.\n\n“We’ve been asked that you carefully evaluate DynaCorps’ case against LAInet,” the older man now said.\n\n“Why?”\n\nThe younger man shifted and leaned forward in his chair, locking eyes with the judge as he told her emphatically, “It would be in the national interest if LAInet were to go into bankruptcy.”\n\nRose Hill’s eyes narrowed as she took in the younger man’s expression and intensity. Her nostrils flared. “Have you any documents to back this up?”\n\n“Are documents required?” the younger man asked. He gave her a slight smile. “I understand you’re up for re-election soon.”\n\n“And what if I am?” Judge Hill asked. “My integrity is not negotiable.” She sat back and flicked a hand at him dismissively. “I’d like to help, gentlemen, but I must move within the realm of the law. If you have a written order, or something that can be filed in this case, I’ll be happy to consider it.”\n\n“I really think you should reconsider,” the older man said, rising from his chair. “We’d prefer not have to go to such extraordinary lengths.”\n\n“Of that I’m certain,” Judge Hill replied.

She added a moment later, “I’m telling Lucy to be ready. That sort of power could wobble the grav arrays.”\n\n“It’s a huge target,” Cody said, suddenly wishing they had far more than just twenty missiles. But… the aliens were so far away, it wouldn’t matter. Unless… “Captain Swale, coordinate and start an intensive search for any possible targets,” Cody ordered.\n\n“Targets sir?”\n\n“Alien recons,” Nora said immediately. “All ships, start a full sweep.”\n\n“Sir,” Captain Swale said. “Why would they have a recon here?”\n\n“I don’t know if they do,” Cody admitted. “But if they’re coming back to Meath…”\n\n“Oh! Yes!” Captain Swale said, nodding to himself. “They would have followed us, just to get a report on our numbers.”\n\n“I’m not sure how they could stealth —” Cody began. “What if they left the ships here?”\n\n“That’d mean they have some at Deneb and Quark,” Captain Swale guessed. “Gidget, send off a sitrep immediately.”\n\nGidget Spears, Tristan’s new comms officer, nodded. She was another addition, along with Captain Swale. He had been added when Cody had been finally forced to admit that he had too much to do to run a ship and a fleet. Fortunately, Captain Swale, a youthful seventy-six, had no problem taking orders from a fifteen year-old. “You’ve got more combat time than anyone, sir,” Swale had told him when they’d interviewed to see how they’d fit. “And anyone would be a fool to turn Dorit Williams down —” Cody had barked a laugh in agreement."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["epub", "paraphrase", "v1"]}

Then I checked the date they were checked out — there was only one that was overdue, so I left that for Dad. I found the cool rubber date stamp and the stamp pad and marked the return date on all the books that had come back. Then I put the little cards in the sleeves in the books. After that, I piled the returned books on a cart. I used the cart and wheeled from row to row. It was fun. There were only about twenty books to shelve, so it didn’t take long.\n\nWhen I was done, I parked the cart back where I’d got it. Then I went looking.\n\n“Magic or religion?” I said to myself. “Or fantasy?” I was wrong.\n\nI found the book filed under ‘D’ for dragon. “There you are!” I frowned as I pulled it from the shelf. It looked odd. Not the way I remembered it. “Did someone hurt you?” I said, incensed that any of our group might not treat the book carefully. The cover looked almost red. And there was a bulge in the front, on the right side, just in the middle. I ran my hand over it — and dropped the book as a spark of magic jerked through me. I caught it before it hit the floor and the same spark of magic flowed into me.\n\nMagic flowed into me. Wait! Dragons give magic. But I’d never felt it this way before.\n\n“Eric?” I said to the Book Without Ends. Eric?\n\n“Holly?” A voice spoke. Not Eric, though. Zeus. He appeared hovering in front of me. “What is that?”\n\nAnd suddenly, my hands were burning. I looked at them, expecting blisters to appear but they didn’t.\n\n“It’s the book,” I told him, “and it’s burning my hands!”\n\nThe book glowed brightly and then it stopped and my hands felt normal.\n\nBut the book didn’t. The bulge moved under my fingers and I pulled them back. The bulge had become rounded and more raised. It was like an oval.\n\n“Zeus, what’s happening to the book?” I cried, looking over at him."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["epub", "continuation", "v1"]}

What direction?” Cody asked.\n\n“We have imagery,” Gail said. “Analyzing.” A moment later she hissed in surprise. “A straight line, sweeping through the middle. Either the ship was above and in front of the hab — about thirty degrees leading — or it was under and below the hab with the opposite angle, three hundred and thirty degrees.”\n\n“Above or below?” In their simulator, Cody glanced to each of them in turn and finally, to Ellaz’s ghost. Ellaz.\n\n“Above,” Jacob said. “Below and there’d be a danger of debris hitting them as it fell to the planet.”\n\nRight. And how much more did that contribute to the destruction of the planet? Not much, really. The planet was already dead.\n\n“How far away?” Cody said. “From the ship to the spacehab?”\n\n“If they have the same lance we do…” Ellaz began. “Not more than a thousand kilometers.”\n\n“Okay, so we come out a thousand kilometers from the spacehab, three hundred and twenty degrees off the planet’s rotation, rotate our nose ten degrees to port and fire the lance,” Cody said."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["epub", "summary", "v1"]}

Everyone on Quark agrees that we need to build proper ships with crew and capacity to deal with these aliens. Now that their fleet has been destroyed, we’re certain that we can take the longer time required to build a properly-hulled series of warships.”\n\n“And I’ve disagreed,” Ellaz Quark said. “And so has Admiral Cartwright.”\n\n“Yes, as we’ve noted before,” Ed Hanlan agreed. “But I have to deal with voters and other people in reaching a consensus on our path forward.” He frowned and shook his head. “If I had infinite resources — infinite cash — I would not hesitate to follow your recommendations in parallel.

We have, unfortunately, felt it necessary to move troops up to the border in order to continue to maintain our sovereignty.” He paused to see if the Minister was following him. When he saw him nod, the Ambassador continued, “We are very nearly at the point of war, sir.”\n\n“War!” The Foreign Minister exclaimed. “That’s terrible, particularly given what’s happening in the States at this time.”\n\n“We cannot let sentimentality to get in the way of our nation,” the Ambassador shot back. “While we are very concerned for our fellow Asians caught up in that horrible disaster — which the United States seems totally incapable of alleviating — we must see to our own national security first.”\n\n“And you are telling me this why, Mr. Ambassador?” The Foreign Secretary asked, just hiding a scowl.\n\n“I have been asked by my government to receive your assurances that the United Kingdom will not participate in any way in this regard,” the Ambassador said.\n\n“Well… I cannot speak for His Majesty’s Government without conferring with my fellow ministers,” the Foreign Minister replied stiffly. “But I take your warning to heart and will communicate it to them at the earliest possible opportunity.”\n\n“You may wish to hurry, sir,” the Ambassador said, bowing stiffly. “Or it may be too late.”\n\n“Thank you,” the Foreign Minister said, nodding back. “And, as you say, this is an important matter, so if you have nothing more to add, I should probably get this information to the Cabinet as quickly as possible.”\n\nThe Korean Ambassador considered his words and nodded, turning to the door. “Thank you, sir, for seeing me so promptly.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["epub", "qa", "v1"]}

Mom turned back to Mr. Mallory, eyeing him oddly but he said, “I won’t hold you up any longer, Mrs. McNee. I fear you’ll have much to set right from last night’s quake.” He shrugged. “Goodness knows I did!”\n\nI was gone, and didn’t hear the rest.\n\n* * *\n\nMrs. Balfour looked ready to chew me up, spit me out and lock me in detention for the rest of the school year. And then she saw the tardy pass. She plucked from me angrily and turned back — but stopped when she saw the signature. In a small voice, she said, “Did he talk to you?”\n\n“Pardon?”\n\nShe frowned, shook her head and gestured me to my seat. “You’ve interrupted class long enough, Miss McNee.”\n\nWanda looked ecstatic that I was in trouble, even if I was excused, with Mrs. Balfour. Natasha smiled but I couldn’t tell if it was in sympathy or satisfaction. Tiffany shook her head. Brian smiled at me and patted the empty desk beside him but… I had an assigned seat.\n\n* * *\n\nI survived until lunchtime. That was when I realized that, in our rush, I hadn’t made a lunch. Brian found me sitting against my tree and passed me an apple and half his sandwich. I smiled at him. He was the best friend. My only friend. He knelt down opposite me.\n\n“Holly…” he began when I finished the sandwich. I looked up at him. “The earthquakes —”\n\nI grinned at him. “Earthquakes, again?”\n\nBrian shook his head. “They aren’t real.”\n\n“What?”\n\nHe made a face. “I mean, they’re real, they’re just not right,” Brian said. “Their period is off and the —” he stopped and shrugged “— well, they’re just not right.”\n\n“Earthquakes aren’t right?” I repeated, trying to understand him.\n\n“What are you talking about, McNee?” Wanda Bee said loudly. She turned to the others who had been walking nearby. “Did you hear that? Holly says earthquakes aren’t real!” She shook her head and laughed. And then she saw my face. “And she’s got a zit the size of Mars!”\n\n“What?” Up until then, Tiffany hadn’t been listening, obviously. “Mars?”\n\nWanda pointed to my face. “There. On Holly’s nose.

I’d been curious to see more of the battlefield since I’d first heard of it from Lieutenant Anderson — God preserve him — and here we were. I squinted at something in the distance. “What are those lines?”\n\n“Rail line from the mine,” Mr. Henry explained. “Some of the English tripped over them in the fight and that helped our side.”\n\n“Well, I don’t think we’ll trip over them.”\n\n“Let’s see, shall we?” Mr. Henry said. “Do you think you can get your Lightning to trot over them?”\n\nIn response, I opened the steam and, following my memory of Mr. Stoops movements, broke us into a good steady trot. A shout from behind me showed that we’d caught the others unawares but then Mr. Henry shouted, “Ah, good lad!” Adding, “Young Malcolm’s no slouch, he’s gaining on you.”\n\n“We’ll see about that!” I said. “Shovel more coal into the fire, if you please.”\n\n“Aye, sir.”\n\nThere was no way Malcolm Reynolds was going to beat me twice. At least, not today.\n\nGauging the interval on the rail lines was tricky but, determined to keep my lead, I only changed the angle we made with them, twisting slightly so that our legs would fall on either side.

She shuddered. A moment later, Hermes leaped in the air with a yowl and raced under the bed.\n\nTiffany glanced after him and then back to me. She held out a hand. “Sisters?”\n\n“Sisters,” I agreed, grabbing her hand tightly.\n\nI let Tiffany have the bed. Because she wanted to sleep with the book under the pillow. And, well, I’d never slept in the sleeping bag on the air mattress before.\n\nHermes, to my surprise, curled up by my head, purring contentedly. It took me a while to fall asleep.

The earth trembles with my strength! I shall not be contained!”\n\n“We can do that, the other way,” Hera replied. “And the children —”\n\n“Bah! Who needs children?” Zeus demanded.\n\n“I should look forward to them,” Hera said wistfully. “And, you know, you can’t get big forever —”\n\n“Who said so?” Zeus roared. “Who dares challenge my authority?”\n\n“It’s not your authority, dear, it’s your girth,” Hera replied soothingly."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["epub", "continuation", "v1"]}

All three of us were about the same size, so it wasn’t hard. After some discussion, we decided that I would take my bed and Tiffany and Natasha would share the air mattress. I got some sheets and we spread them and then opened the sleeping bag to spread over them. They had to share a pillow, though.\n\nHermes decided to curl up with them. Natasha asked if she could sleep with the book, because she hadn’t yet.\n\nWith two other people in the room, it took me a while to doze off. But… well, I knew Brian was downstairs. We’d been each other’s safety for — well, for ever. So that assured me. And… Tiffany was the best. And so was Natasha. I… I felt comfortable. And protective. Witches. And, I guess, a wizard.\n\nAnd we knew absolutely nothing.\n\nSomehow, I fell asleep.\n\n* * *\n\nI dreamed. We were together, all three — no, four — of us. We were running. We were running so fast, faster than the wind. And something was chasing after us. If it caught us, we’d die.\n\nThe dream shifted. Brilliant red eyes glowed out of the darkness. Zeus. He was furious.\n\n“How did they do that? How did they thwart me?” He growled.\n\n“Dear, just leave them alone, they know nothing,” Hera replied soothingly.\n\n“There are four of them,” Zeus rumbled. “I must try again. She is the most vulnerable —”\n\n“And yet you couldn’t hold her,” Hera replied. “Perhaps you shouldn’t try.”\n\nA bright flame blew out from below the flaming red eyes and burned through my dream.\n\nIt shifted and I found myself looking into a huge cavern. There was light in the background. I was a girl. A witch. I was scared, petrified. But I wasn’t going to give up.\n\n“The dragons must not fly!”\n\n* * *\n\n“...not fly!” Natasha murmured in her sleep as my eyes popped open. I turned to her — and saw Tiffany’s eyes meet mine.

Homework was late. I was late getting into bed. And the zit. It wasn’t getting smaller, it was getting bigger. ZitZilla. It hurt, too.\n\nI guess because of all that, I had bad dreams. I was in my room, sitting at my desk. The weird book was there. Sitting by my laptop on the table.\n\n“I wish I could get rid of this zit!” I said, staring up at the mirror on my wall. (There is no mirror on my wall.)\n\n“Is that what you wish for?” A boy’s piping voice spoke in my ear. I looked up to see him reflected in my mirror.\n\nIn my dream, he was someone I knew. Erich. His eyes were blue. His hair was jet black. His face — he looked like someone who was dying. His cheeks were sunken, gaunt, his face yellow. There was yellow in the whites of his eyes, too.\n\n“I think I am dead,” Erich says. “Or I should be but meine schöne schwester —!”\n\n“What?” I said.\n\nThe dream jumped. Erich said, “What do you really wish for?”\n\n“Everyone knows that,” I say, annoyed that he even had to ask. “I want my father. I’ve never even seen him.”\n\n“Yes, you have,” Erich replied.\n\n“He’s not here!” I sobbed. “Not with me and mom!”\n\nAnd then I woke up. Tears stained my cheeks and my stomach felt hollow. I turned over and clutched my stomach, feeling like I was going to heave. No, feeling empty. Like there was a hole in me that I couldn’t fill. I thought of Mr. Miller and his giggling girls. Why couldn’t I have that?\n\nWith a growl, I sat up and flicked on the light on my desk. The book — the weird book — was there. I looked at it. I thought I’d hidden it away.

Of course, the aliens outnumbered Gail’s survivors fifteen to two — well, fourteen to two, now.\n\n“Force Gail is two minutes away from the aliens,” Steve Ahmet reported.

I knew that.\n\n“I’ll be fine,” she said, forcing herself to smile. “Dean Harte likes to run a taught ship, is all.” She waved me to the door. “Go on! You don’t want to be late!”\n\nI left, but slowly.\n\n* * *\n\nThe next class was Art. I love Art. I’m not good at it. Mr. Miller was our teacher. He was, like, middle-aged and he had three daughters, all just a bit younger than us. I knew because he told us in the first class. He was great.\n\n“Today, we’re going to pair up,” Mr. Miller declared. He pointed to me and Tiff. “You two,” his finger moved on and he picked Wanda and Tasha, and on and on until he stopped and looked around. “There’s an odd one out, who is it?”\n\nSlowly Brian raised his hand. “Ah, Brian! You’re going to work with me.” He waved around. “Everyone pick a table. There are two easels on it with paper set out already. Today we’re going to practice live drawing. Get seated now.”\n\nTiffany raced to a seat and waved me over. She picked up an easel and frowned at the large stick of charcoal. “What’s this?”\n\nWell, my mom was many things. An artist was one of them. In fact, I’m pretty sure if it weren’t for the shop — and eating — she’d be much happier in a studio, painting. But we had charcoal sticks because Mom offered art classes at the store.

In an instant, she had wrapped a hand around a small fluttering form.\n\n“I got it!” Ellay cried in delight, turning to show her fist to Smitty. “I caught a butterfly, Smitty.”\n\n“Child—” Smitty began slowly, trying to break the news to her gently, but Ellay’s expression had already faded, changing from joy to anxiety and then horror as she raised her hand and lowered her head to view the contents of her palm.\n\n“It’s not moving.” With her free hand, Ellay poked at the still form and then looked up to Smitty. “It’s not moving, what do I do?”\n\n“Sweetie … there’s nothing you can do,” Smitty said, moving to kneel beside her and peer at the lifeless butterfly. “It’s dead.”\n\n“Dead?” Ellay repeated. “Ceased function, reached entropy, started to decay.” She turned pleading eyes up to Smitty. “Fix it, please?”\n\nSmitty shook his head. “I can’t honey, it’s dead.”\n\n“Can’t we add energy, reverse entropy?”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["epub", "summary", "v1"]}

There, it will start to curve eastwards while still moving north. The higher ground will slow it down and it will start to dissipate but not before its swamps New Haven, and Hartford Connecticut and then Springfield, Massachusetts, veering to flood Boston, head into New Hampshire, and then break down near Portland, Maine by which time it should just be a depression with winds around thirty-nine miles an hour.”\n\n“The worst for New York is while Isaac is paused in the Sound,” Egan said. He glanced to Mackey. “How are we coming on that?”\n\n“That’s when Isaac will drive waves down Manhattan,” Mackey said grimly. “Because the hurricane rotates counter-clockwise, it will push the waves south but with the storm where it is, there will be no place for the water to go, so the flooding levels will build significantly.”\n\n“How significantly?” Andrea asked.\n\n“We have some predictions ranging up to four hundred feet,” Egan told her. She shot him a look of surprise and he shrugged. “The largest wave ever measured was over seventeen hundred feet.”\n\n“Seventeen twenty, to be exact,” Mackey said. “That’s just fifty-six feet less than the tallest building in Manhattan.”\n\n“And the buildings?” Naomi asked. “What about them?”\n\n“What about the people in them?” Egan countered.\n\n“Would it help to release imagery?” Naomi asked. “Get more people to evacuate?”\n\nEgan glanced to Andrea who shrugged in reply.\n\n“And what happens after?” Naomi persisted.

Only his cat looks like a baby white tiger… most of the time. Well, for all of the five minutes we’ve known him. And Erich has Echo. You know, like in the Greek tragedy? Erich didn’t have a body for five hundred years, so Echo agreed to take on the job. Seeing as Echo could only Echo what was said to her, this works out perfectly.\n\n“Holly?” Said the cat on my shoulder. Zeus. “I’d like to show you around.” I’d gone back to pick up the old book that Erich had lived in and I had it tucked under my other arm — the one Zeus wasn’t perched on.\n\n“Hmm?” I was distracted. I mean, I’d just saved… well, all of us. I wanted a moment of glory but everyone — my friends and witches — had been dragged off by their familiars to go exploring. I was the only one who thought to pick up the book that had once held Erich’s soul. “Oh, sure!”\n\n“Well, you don’t have to sound so excited about it!” Zeus snapped. “Turn around and march straight ahead, I’ll guide you the rest of the way.”\n\nSo I turned and we started walking. The underground cavern was huge. Really, really huge.\n\n“Zeus, this is amazing!” I said as we came to a spot where a dozen or more hallways broke off and spread out.

I showed him the drawing, explained the workings and let him ponder on them. I could see his face grow thoughtful — Jamie hadn’t my love of metal but he was just as quick in seeing how things moved as I was and I could see his excitement grow as he imagined how the engine moved.\n\n“It’s not very efficient,” Jamie said and I grinned at him.\n\n“Aye, it’s not,” I agreed. “Nothing a Scotsman couldn’t fix.”\n\n“If ye had the right Scotsman,” he muttered doubtfully. I smiled at him and he groaned. “Not you!”\n\nI pulled out my next sketch and just laid it under his eyes. I didn’t say anything, letting him follow the logic himself. I held my breath because Jamie was very clever and if anyone could find fault, it’d be he.\n\nHe pointed at the one plug that was left in my drawing. “This starts it and stops it?”\n\nI nodded. He smiled. “Very nice,” he allowed. “Efficient.”\n\nI said nothing but inside, I beamed.\n\nThen Jamie shook his head. “So, it’s nice but what of it, Danni?”\n\nI pulled out the next sketch and Jamie grunted in surprise.

At the appropriate time, a circuit breaker in CIA Langley will trip — owing to moisture — and break the satellite feed. The time to isolate, repair, and recover from the failure should be more than enough to cover the fleet’s departure.

The effects on the US and world economy would be catastrophic. The balance of power would move irretrievably into the hands of the Chinese.\n\nMajor Risk Factors: Currently the unpredictable weather is the greatest factor constraining the PRC from carrying out the reunification of Taiwan with the PRC.\n\nAdditional Considerations:\n\nAir Superiority. PLAN must get and maintain air superiority prior to any invasion (see Appendix C).\n\nNaval Forces: PLAN would gather naval forces in the two principal invasion ports and require good weather to execute the invasion. Extensive use of LCAC’s (six Yuyi-class ships capable of 80 knots) would allow PLAN to land in excess of two armored divisions in the first wave (see Appendix B).\n\nAcquisitions of the southern beaches (see Appendix D) would be the first phase followed by a river assault up to Taipei with the intent to capture the capital city (see Appendix A).\n\nAdditional Supporting Assaults would be launched, as necessary, to assure the complete subjugation of the island (Appendix E).\n\nCare must be taken to avoid the destruction of major industrial targets (e.g.: TSMC) directly or by sabotage.\n\nSpecial Forces and Airborne assault are assumed for the encirclement of Taipei (see Appendix F).\n\nAvailable Assault Windows:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["epub", "paraphrase", "v1"]}

Hillary Gallant was an old spacer from way back and, at eighty-two, a respected naval warrior who’d amassed a lengthy career before retiring. She’d jumped at the chance to lead a division of the new ships. Just as had seventy-eight year old Norris Keck had jumped on his chance to command Bahrain — he’d lost relatives on that particular spacehab and so was super-motivated. Neither of the two were considered very old nowadays and both were broad-minded enough to accept Cody’s leadership and Emma’s command of the Courier Fleet.\n\n“I’m afraid I’m going to have to leave two at Perky, too,” Emma continued. “I mean, these ships are brand new and so’s the threat. Leaving them on station is not only wise from a defensive point of view but also from a corporate standpoint, too.”\n\n“Yeah,” Cody said. “Did you charge ‘em?”\n\n“Well, Fafnir is currently ruled by the Grimm and they were talking about stopping all my ships,” Emma said. “But we came to an arrangement.”\n\nThe Grimm — Cody had read up a little on them — they were a syndicated ruling class. Cody didn’t like the notion of them but apparently the Fafnirans were happy enough that they hadn’t revolted. Fafnir was a signatory to the Interstellar Convention On Rights and, from what Cody could tell, generally respected intellectual property rights. The star system was home to close to twelve billion souls and had expanded to create a number of daughter colonies in nearby star systems — it was well on its way to becoming its own star empire, in fact.\n\n“That’s just going to leave you with three ships,” Cody remarked.\n\n“Can’t be helped, I’m afraid,” Emma replied. “But the Grimm have agreed to build two full-fledged destroyers licensing our single ring technology.”\n\n“Do they know about the tach comm?” Cody asked.\n\n“Yes,” Emma said. “We’ve licensed that as well, through four different outfits.”\n\n“To prevent monopolies,” Cody guessed. Monopolies — from what he’d read — were big on Fafnir.\n\n“Exactly!” Emma agreed. “And ditto for the warp rings.”\n\n“What about the weapons?” Cody asked."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["epub", "qa", "v1"]}

Have you thought of that, John?”\n\nGreen’s smile slipped.\n\nThe president glanced around the room and found the Secretary of State. “Linda, be ready to smooth any ruffled feathers when we get this all sorted out.”\n\n“You can count on me, sir.”\n\nThe president nodded; the funny thing was that he could count on her. She’d been a very political appointment, and he’d taken a lot of flack over it, but she’d worked out surprisingly well.\n\n“The worst’ll be over when the ASATs get the satellites,” Green said. “After that, we’ll only have to worry about mopping up at the nuke plant.”\n\n“You mean like the Japanese did at the Fukushima plant?” The president said acerbically.\n\nGreen paled. He was distracted as a general rushed in and passed him a note. The president raised an eyebrow.\n\n“We’ve got reports that the Koreans are mobilizing,” Green said, as he scanned the report. He frowned and added, “And the Russians, and the Chinese.”\n\n“Shit,” the president said. He turned to the Secretary of State, “Linda, get on the horn with the Premier in China and have someone get me a line to the Russian Ambassador. I’ll explain.”\n\n“Sir, that’s not a good idea,” Green protested. “If they planned these attacks, you’re giving them valuable information.”\n\n“I doubt they both planned these attacks,” the president replied. “And I’d rather have to worry about only one nation at a time, if I can.”\n\nJohn Green flipped a hand open in agreement. “As you say, sir.”\n\n“Have someone bring in some coffee and snacks,” the President said. “This is going to be a long night.”\n\nAn aide rushed out of the room. Linda Worthington rose from her seat. “I’ll get back as soon as I can, sir.”\n\nThe President nodded. Just as she left, the phone on his desk rang.\n\n“Yes?” he said. A moment later he frowned, raised a hand, and clicked his fingers for attention, pointing to the Secretary for Homeland Security. “Ms. MacDonald, how did you get this number?”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["epub", "qa", "v1"]}

A moment later he turned back, “They’re on their way, sir. Fifteen minutes.”\n\nCody nodded.

And that will alter the gravity pattern throughout.”\n\n“Right,” Cody said, annoyed that they hadn’t considered this earlier. “So how soon can we get the array back on-line?”\n\n“What we’re trying to do is figure out a way to automatically compensate,” Boris said, blowing out a sigh.\n\n“Well, can you?”\n\n“Of course, sir,” Ursula said. “The question is how long after will it take before we get good readings?”\n\n“And that’s the problem?” Cody asked.

I’d say that we have to guess that they’ve scouted out at least Fafnir, Perky, and Jasib. Probably Queen’s, too. Queen’s was the star system over one hundred and fifty-five light-years from Deneb.\n\nWho named a system Perky, anyway? Gail wondered.\n\nThat would be Dorothea Parker, Ellaz told her. Apparently she was six and given the honor of naming the new home world.\n\nShe’d just lost her cat, so she named the system after her, Cody added. It was a story told everywhere and often, being beloved by many. The system lived up to its name and, nearly two hundred years after its founding, was one of the leading lights in the Fifth Quadrant.\n\nOld Earth had expanded mankind out into a wild shape rather like a starfish with five arms. Eighteen worlds — more or less — were part of each quadrant. The Fifth Quadrant got its name because some newsie had decided to name it thus and the name, despite all objections, stuck. But the Fifth Quadrant was really no different from the First Quadrant, aside from the obvious bragging rights.\n\nThey may have scouted the whole Fifth Quadrant, Nora thought.\n\nWell, they only have twenty-five ships, Cody reminded them.

The guard cast a look my way and then back to the girls. “Very well,” he said. He tapped his phone and got a beep in reply. “We’re ready, let’s move.”\n\nEagerly and skipping the others took off. Tiffany turned back and gave me a finger wave. I smiled and waved back. And then they were out of sight, on the way to the parking lot.\n\n“Holly?” Dad said. I turned back to him. “I thought we could all use a quiet night at home.”\n\nI forced myself to cheer up. “Yeah, sure!”\n\n***\n\nMaybe Dad was right. It certainly was nice to eat with Mom and just banter. But… we were all worried. It put a damper on things. They exchanged glances and then Mom said to me, “How do you feel about surprises?”\n\n“Good surprises or bad ones?” I asked cautiously.\n\nMom snorted and Dad considered the question. “Good,” he said.\n\n“Um, okay,” I said.\n\nDad waved for Mom to go ahead. She smiled and said, “How do you feel about becoming a sister?”\n\n“Huh?”\n\nDad leaned forward, grinning from ear to ear. “You’re going to be a big sister, Holly!”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["epub", "continuation", "v1"]}

A moment later, he brightened, “Susan! Pete here,” he said looking cheerful. “Listen, do you know about this storm developing on the East Coast?” He sat back, listening. “Is there anything you guys can do? I mean, I know you’ve got those solar power satellites almost online.” He listened, his expression growing more and more grim. Finally, he said, “Yeah, that’s what I’ve been hearing here, too.” He sighed. “So a lot of people will die, billions will be lost and… there’s nothing we can do about it?”\n\n“Not at this time,” Simmons said. Pete shot him a look. “We can predict and we can spot resources but…” He shook his head.\n\n“Okay,” Johnson said. “Listen, Susan, thanks for listening. I’ve got some reports to make.” He listened again, grinned, and said, “Sure, I’ll buy you a pizza!”\n\n“And one for Janey, too,” Susan Moore said loudly over the phone. “Be good, Pete, and don’t hesitate to call if you think we can help.”\n\n“Absolutely!” Pete Johnson said, hanging up. He sat back in his chair, closed his eyes and blew out a breath. Finally, he sat up and turned to Simmons. “Okay, so what does it mean, this treason charge?”\n\n“The biggest thing is that it means we’re closer to weather control,” Simmons said. “And there are a lot of people who know. It’ll come out soon enough.”\n\n“And?”\n\n“And when it does, how is the world going to react?”\n\n“We’ll be accused of every flood, every drought, every bad day any nation has anywhere,” Pete Johnson said immediately.

And then, inside a warded circle, we tried small magic. Like making our sigils — our little flame signs.\n\nMrs. Belle stayed outside the circle, using the spells she knew to try to locate our magic. Our spells were very small, however, because we weren’t certain we couldn’t be detected.\n\nThe bell rang and we all raced around the room, sweeping up the salt and herbs, re-arranging the desks and putting the room back together.\n\nEnglish was next, with Dad, but honestly, I couldn’t remember what we did, I was too jazzed up from our last class. After that we had Async — Asynchronous Learning — which meant that we broke into groups and studied together. Async was held in one of the large labs up on the second floor where we could spread out and be loud without interfering with each other. I was with Brian, of course, and we whizzed through our module only to look up and find Wanda looking at us wistfully. I held up our module workbook and said, “You too?”\n\nWanda fished through her backpack and pulled out the same workbook, smiling.\n\n“Come on,” I said, gesturing her to sit beside me. “We’ll work on it together.”\n\n“But you’re already done!” Wanda said.\n\n“I am,” I agreed, “but Brian and I will start in on the math module and I’ll answer any questions you have. So we can double-study.”\n\nIt wasn’t two minutes later that Anna tapped me on the shoulder. “Math?” She nodded glumly and leaned down to whisper to me, “I know this, I just can’t remember.”\n\nI pointed to the seat opposite me and she took it.\n\n“How can she know it?” Wanda said under her breath to me. “We haven’t studied it yet.” I shook my head."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["epub", "qa", "v1"]}

He walked on, not too briskly.\n\nThirty seconds later, the mobile phone’s battery overheated, melting it and the phone completely.\n\nThe man at the other end of the phone call ditched his mobile phone in much the same way, only he made one more call first. That was all that was needed. When the call was answered, the far end howled with the old noise of a dialup modem. He pressed another key sequence and the modem sound died. With a grunt, he broke the connection, dialed the same number that his previous caller had dialed and threw his mobile phone into a dumpster.\n\nThe modem receiving the first call connected to a computer that was attached to the local network. In moments it activated several programs.\n\nThe first program brought an illegal botnet—a collection of hacked computers—to life. They began a software assault on a number of network routers—the machines that were the modern day equivalent of telephone operators for the Internet—overflowing them with requests and swamping them.\n\nUnder cover of the first assault, a second assault was launched.

Sure, our first Walker and the Scuttler had done well enough in the assault on the Castle but that had been a special case, the first time the Walkers were ever used in war. How much news of their actions had reached Carlisle was anyone’s guess but news always traveled faster when it was novel and the British were certain to pay dear for any news explaining the Castle’s loss.\n\nWe worked until it was too dark for even torches to let us see and then called it a night. Samuel, for all his urgency was wrong: his Walker wasn’t yet finished.\n\nEarly the next morning, however, he and his crew ran it through its paces. Samuel, who’d worked the Scuttler, was well-pleased with his mount and grinned from ear to ear as he raced it across the fields.\n\n“It flies, Danni, it flies!” he shouted as he raced past me, leaving a trail of steam and smoke as the loud, steady, thump-thump-thump-thump of the Walker made a dance on the ground.\n\nHe turned it around gamely — better than I’d managed, I regret to say — and raced it back to the forge, ready to mount the guns.\n\n“The guns wait until we’ve finished the second Walker, ensign,” Lieutenant Anderson reminded him, gesturing toward his still-unfinished Prestonpans.\n\n“Aye, sir!” Samuel said, saluting and blowing off the steam of the boiler. He grinned at me and called, “Danni, get a barrow and we’ll see how your latest invention works!”\n\nRather than racing myself, I nodded toward Mapes who gave me a look but dutifully trotted off to get the wheelbarrow. It was one of MacAllister’s so I cared not the least whether it survived.\n\n“That’s right!” I called to Mapes as he positioned it under the Walker. “Now get away!” As soon as he was clear, I waved at Samuel and said, “Any time now!”\n\nWith a whoop of joy, Samuel pulled a special lever that had only been installed on these last two Walkers and, in one loud roar, the entire load of fire and flaming coals that had been feeding the boiler were dumped out of their grate into the waiting barrow below."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["epub", "qa", "v1"]}

It was heavier and thicker than a mere plastic bag. Squatting, he used the outside of the bag to sweep the remains of the cell phone into it. Satisfied that he’d got everything, he closed the ziplock on the bag, pressed it tightly for a few moments, then searched for a thicker, solid capsule on the edge of the bag. He pressed his fingers tightly against it and felt it break open. He shoved the bag back into the drawer, stood up and sat back in his chair.

The Pope was a warm and engaging presence, even at a distance, and to be able to attend a Mass in which he was a celebrant—particularly Christmas—was a memory to be cherished.\n\n“Odd that you should say that,” Carolo replied, cocking his head to one side as though sizing Father Giovanni up for supernatural powers, “for it is because of His Excellency that we are speaking today.”\n\n“Oh?”\n\n“Indeed,” Father Carolo replied. “I have been told that the Curator of the Vatican Museum learned of our latest developments—you wouldn’t know anything about that, would you?”\n\n“No,” Father Giovanni said. “Although it has been rather difficult to keep people from talking—after all, a perfect replica of Michelangelo’s Sistine Chapel is quite remarkable.”\n\n“Quite,” Carolo agreed, pinning Giovanni with a gimlet gaze for several silent seconds before continuing, “but it is not a perfect replica.” Giovanni twitched. “In fact, the Curator inspected it quite closely, brought in several specialists, and then appealed to His Excellency as a matter of some urgency.…”\n\n“Pardon?”\n\n“The specialists and the Curator discovered that the replica is, in fact, something much more,” Father Carolo said. Suddenly, his entire expression changed and he grew wistful. “Have you looked at it?

Brian was next to her.\n\nI nodded, opening my backpack. “They’re a bit creased —”\n\n“It won’t matter,” Natasha said as I handed hers to her. She put it on over her clothes and grabbed the witch’s hat I had for her. It was black and pointy but with a stylish rose on the front. Natasha smiled as she put it on.\n\nBy the time she was done, the others were dressed, too. My hat was orange, as was my outfit. It fit perfectly.

Normally, with two rings, the warp bubble was the shape of a bulging cylinder — smooth along the ship’s axis, curving outwards at either end of the ship. The warp bubble engulfed the ship into another dimension.\n\nBut this one ring warp was different. It was shaped more like a spinning top — two cones back to back.

Then he imagined the bubble surrounding them thickening, going more and more opaque until it was almost impossible to see the stars outside.\n\n“Too much, Cody!” Edie said. “That’s about Warp Nine point five. You want to see some stars or you’ll go too fast.”\n\nAnd run out of fuel, Ellaz added through the mind-link.

He turned to the other captain. “And you?”\n\n“Yes sir!” Morgan Summers called back fiercely. Cody was surprised that the Research Board had selected her for the job of testing Intrepid, which was the name they’d given the ring test ship. Actually, Intrepid was the name of the Tendaya-class ship that would travel inside the two three point eight kilometer diameter warp rings. They were to follow the standard test procedures, starting with Warp One and working up to Warp Seven — Cody’s objections had been overridden by the Research Board.\n\nThe Research Board consisted of himself, Nora, Emma, Gail, Dorit Williams, Lucy King, Don Hartman and all of Lucy’s copies — Ellaz, Tilly, and the rest of them.

Cody didn’t like the notion of them but apparently the Fafnirans were happy enough that they hadn’t revolted. Fafnir was a signatory to the Interstellar Convention On Rights and, from what Cody could tell, generally respected intellectual property rights. The star system was home to close to twelve billion souls and had expanded to create a number of daughter colonies in nearby star systems — it was well on its way to becoming its own star empire, in fact.\n\n“That’s just going to leave you with three ships,” Cody remarked.\n\n“Can’t be helped, I’m afraid,” Emma replied. “But the Grimm have agreed to build two full-fledged destroyers licensing our single ring technology.”\n\n“Do they know about the tach comm?” Cody asked.\n\n“Yes,” Emma said. “We’ve licensed that as well, through four different outfits.”\n\n“To prevent monopolies,” Cody guessed.

She tends to get too focused without the others to moderate her.”\n\n“She seemed to grow the more I worked with her,” Don admitted. He raised a hand. “And she is a little girl, I know!” His expression hardened as he added, “I’ve had time to read the after action reports. I should know better, from those. Gail, the real Gail, is a hero.”\n\nCody and Nora both nodded emphatically.\n\n“If I could have told her —” Cody began.\n\nNora snorted and he shot her a look. “I was thinking the same thing!”\n\n“Well, I believe you might want to look at Annex Three in your briefing, then, Admiral, Commodore,” Don said. He waved them to the hatch. “I’ll leave you to it.”\n\nBack in their shuttle, Cody and Nora said to Gail and Emma, “Annex Three?”\n\n“Tach comms,” Gail said, looking up from where she was lounging in a stretched out combat chair. Quark’s interiors were more opulent than the shuttles they found at Deneb and Meath.\n\n“They’ve increased bandwidth by three orders of magnitude,” Emma added. “And they sent out a test rig with the tender.”\n\n“So Midway will have tach comms?”\n\n“That’s the plan,” Emma said. “Actually, we’ll know when we get back. I put a bug in Boris’ ear and he’s going to run the test before we drop out of warp at Quark.”\n\n“Read up,” Nora said, pointing Cody to a chair of his own. “Admiral.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["epub", "paraphrase", "v1"]}

Taurus was an older freighter, steady, reliable, and invaluable in hauling their gear out here.

Hermes would get there in just over twelve hours.\n\n“Can’t be helped,” Cody said. “Just tell Percy to get her back ASAP.”\n\nPercy Leyton was Don Hartman’s hand-picked executive officer. He’d taken the time on Quark to get an implant and was working well with the ‘crew’ — Ellaz, Nora, Gail, and the copy of Cody himself.\n\nDon Hartman had allowed Cody to detach the lightship away from him but with the proviso that Cody had to send it back to Quark at least one day prior to the aliens’ arrival.\n\n“So now we know that we’ve got a range of about ten light-years,” Ursula said, “given that we’d picked up these readings so many days ago, only we didn’t verify them until now.” She glared at Boris but it had no effect.\n\n“Captain Kelner, freeze the arrays,” Cody ordered.

A shout from behind me showed that we’d caught the others unawares but then Mr. Henry shouted, “Ah, good lad!” Adding, “Young Malcolm’s no slouch, he’s gaining on you.”\n\n“We’ll see about that!” I said. “Shovel more coal into the fire, if you please.”\n\n“Aye, sir.”\n\nThere was no way Malcolm Reynolds was going to beat me twice. At least, not today.\n\nGauging the interval on the rail lines was tricky but, determined to keep my lead, I only changed the angle we made with them, twisting slightly so that our legs would fall on either side. We traipsed across them easily but a shout from the rear and a series of cries told me that Malcolm had not been so lucky."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["epub", "paraphrase", "v1"]}

Want to get our tech, our gear, and our software.”\n\n“And the first people they’ll fire are finance and HR,” Abby said with a grimace. She pointed to herself.\n\n“You never know,” Susan said. Abby shot her a look. “Well, look at Boeing and McDonnell-Douglas.”\n\n“Oh, yeah! There’s a great example!” Abby snorted bitterly. “Death by takeover!”\n\nBoeing had acquired not only the other aerospace corporation but had ‘integrated’ a large part of its management — to its ultimate detriment, many said. Certainly that had been the start of Boeing’s decline as a bleeding-edge aerospace company, allowing nimbler outfits like SpaceX to outperform the old established airplane manufacturer. Some said that Boeing went from a philosophy of “What can we do?” to “What can we get away with?”\n\n“Okay, what can we do?” Susan asked, reflecting Boeing’s earlier philosophy.\n\n“We’re a services provider,” Al said. “And without customers…” he broke off and shrugged helplessly.

Somewhere along the way, he dropped his hand to his side with his report in it but he didn’t stop reading.\n\n“Mr. Herald,” Mrs. Balfour interrupted, “are you reading your report?”\n\n“Yes,” Brian said, looking to her in consternation for a moment before continuing in his deadly monotone.\n\n“Mr. Herald,” Mrs. Balfour interrupted again, waving to the wad of paper in his hand at his side, “it’s customary to actually look at the paper when reading.”\n\nBrian looked dismayed. I shot out of my chair and called, “He’s got it memorized, Mrs. Balfour.”\n\nMrs. Balfour looked at me angrily, then at Brian, then at me again in a ‘Really?’ look. Finally, she sighed. “Continue, Mr. Herald.”\n\nThe rest of the class loved this. I think some of them thought that we were making fun of Mrs. Balfour. Some of them were just glad that the time was dragging on so they were unlikely to be called on to read their reports.\n\nBrian droned on and on until he finished his report. He raised it up again, as if to confirm that he’d read it all and then passed it over to Mrs. Balfour. It was a thorough report, complete with critique of the Greek mythology invoked and why it did not work in modern times. Because, Brian.\n\n“Thank you, Mr. Herald —” Mrs. Balfour began.

Can you imagine a robot getting a bad shoulder?”\n\nSo maybe she wasn’t a robot. Maybe she was just an anorexic. She didn’t eat, had bad hair because of it, and wrenched her shoulder because she was too thin. Andrea’s lips twitched in sympathy.\n\n“She doesn’t look anorexic,” Andrea said aloud, her eyes narrowing as she considered it. “Thin, yes, but she’s got curves.”\n\nFace it girl, she chided herself silently, you’re jealous. There was a quiet intensity in the woman, something that seemed to attract men.\n\n“She’s kinda crazy, too,” Andrea said aloud. “What’s all this about earthquakes? Was she terrorized as a child?

And we need it if the amount of traffic increases as predicted.”\n\n“And we can sell FM tach comm after we’ve given away the AM version,” Cody guessed. Ellaz wasn’t quite the capitalist that Nora was but she’d been learning. For that matter, so had Cody. “Why not go straight to digital?”\n\n“Because we can’t,” Ellaz said. “You need a flow of tachyons to either impress with an amplitude or a frequency.”\n\n“Ellaz, what’s interfering with our AM signals?” Cody asked. “And why didn’t we get a clear reading from DS1?”\n\n“I’ve been thinking about that,” Ellaz said. “And that’s why me and Eber —”\n\n“Eber?”\n\n“Ellaz Eber,” Ellaz said testily. “That’s why we worked out the FM system.”\n\n“Which isn’t secure,” Cody said.\n\n“Nor is our AM now,” Ellaz said. “Why do we need —?” She broke off as she realized the answer. “It’d be harder but once we’ve got the FM nailed, we could try building a spread spectrum system.”\n\nSpread spectrum was a way of communicating on a number of different wavelengths simultaneously — hopping from one to the other. It was very hard to intercept.\n\n“Ellaz?” Cody said. “Is there any indication that others are using spread spectrum?”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["epub", "continuation", "v1"]}

But… difficult. How will you manage them and avoid interference?”\n\n“We have control units for each and a master coordinator,” Nora said.

But I told her that one hundred thousand klics was good enough for me.”\n\n“Tell her that I want five hundred thousand,” Cody said, grinning.\n\n“Sir!” Leyton protested. Then, “Yeah that would be better, wouldn’t it?”\n\n“And think what it would mean for a mirror,” Cody taunted him. The warp lances were a precision weapon, the warp mirrors were an area defense. Of course, anyone shooting a warp lance at a warp mirror would — at the very least, miss. Better, with a guided mirror, the shot would be reflected back into the attacker. As Cody had done to the alien ship with Hope back in Deneb.\n\nThe lances and mirrors used the same principles, so in theory a five hundred thousand kilometer warp lance would translate into a huge area at two hundred thousand kilometers — more than enough to protect a fifty megatonne starship and, perhaps, enough to ward off an attack on a spacehab. Saving a planet, however, was unlikely with the warp mirrors they had. The best defense in that case was destroying all the attackers."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["epub", "paraphrase", "v1"]}

It had been set up by the magnate William Buckley over thirty years before, Cody saw from the data entry on it. Carlow Shipping had produced over forty starships, mostly in the two megatonne range. It had the reputation of making good, moderately priced ships.\n\nWhen Cody looked at the displays of the ground beneath them, all he saw were wrecks. The main dome was shattered, as were all the corridors connecting to other habitats, workshops, power plants, hydroponics gardens — anything where humans might live.\n\nHis instruments warned him of several radiation hotspots, including one huge mess that had been a ship dockyard.\n\n“They nuked the Nautilus,” Edie murmured from behind him. “That ship was nearly flight ready.” She examined her displays more. “Huh, they didn’t spend any effort on the new builds, though.”\n\n“Why?” Cody asked.\n\n“My guess?” Clive Bamber said. “They were raiders. They came in quick and left quick.” He made a face. “Which is why we’re here.”\n\n“But not for long,” Ellaz said, starting up a new tracking routine. “Even without the extra mouths —”\n\n“We know,” Clive said, jerking a hand toward young Jasmine.\n\nEllaz scowled. “She’s just two years younger than me and I’m pretty sure she can do the math.”\n\n“Less than a year,” Jasmine piped up. “Even with the original five hundred, that’s all they’ve got. They’re not rigged to be self-sustaining.”\n\n“What would it take to do that?” Cody wondered. “I mean —” he waved a hand toward the shattered hydroponics dome “— we’ve got soil here.”\n\n“You need bacteria,” Moira Collins pointed out.\n\n“The compost tanks,” Ellaz said. “We could pull from that —”\n\n“You need transport, fuel and —” Clive added grumpily.\n\n“Wait one!” Cody said, turning the shuttle sharply around and descending.

The curvature you’re proposing… it’s nuts!” He turned incredulously to Nora. “Who needs… what are you thinking?”\n\n“Big,” Lucy said, peering at the new design. “Really big.” She turned to Nora. “You want to warp a hab?” Nora nodded.

I raised my eyebrows in surprise. “Someone might recognize them later.”\n\nYeah, right. If we used rocks from the Caverns for spells, someone might find the used rocks and begin to wonder where they came from.\n\n“Good point,” I said even as I heard Anna and Tiffany’s approach back to Brian’s lab. They were laughing and giggling. “Hey, that’s a great idea!”\n\nThey entered the room and looked at me in surprise.\n\n“Laughing spell,” I said. “Cheer or something.”\n\n“But can we do it?” Anna asked.\n\n“We won’t know until we find out,” Tiffany said.\n\nBrian’s phone beeped. “We’ve got five minutes,” he said. We were splitting our time, half down here, half up in the classroom. When our time was up, the others would come down. And make more spells.\n\n“Just think happy thoughts,” I guessed, throwing my finger out toward my quarter and doing just that.\n\n“That’s not as good as Hide,” Brian said.\n\n“If they’re laughing too hard they won’t be doing anything else,” I said. “At least, we can test it.” We did. And I was right. So right that I had to create Sorrow to stop Brian from laughing uncontrollably. He wiped his eyes when I threw it at him but at least he stopped laughing.\n\n“That was mean,” Brian said as we headed back up to the library.\n\n“Sorry,” I told him. I wasn’t sure which was worse — Laughter or Tears.\n\n“But it worked,” Brian said, crawling through the hole that was the Door.

He coughed and I saw blood come up. Idly he raised a hand to wipe away his mouth and pulled it back in surprise as he saw the blood on it. He dropped his hand as though it were inconsequential, then looked back at me. “We fired back, the gunner was good but he was killed and I had to aim the last shot myself.”\n\n“You did great, Mal, just great!” I told him even as my heart shrank in my body.

I stayed in the cabin while he worked and looked in the gloomy light at the others. Fortunately, they were very few.\n\n“Are there any others from the walker?”\n\n“No,” the surgeon said. “Most are falls from the top.” From his tone, I could tell that he expected to be covering them soon. “Your young ensign was the worst, though.”\n\nI nodded shakily and turned to leave.

He’d stood with her at his funeral. “And that’s sorta why for me, too.”\n\n“Mind you, this is a good launch,” Al said. “We’ve got three birds going up, all for different orbits.”\n\n“Yeah,” Riordan agreed. “Who the heck needs so many clocks?”\n\n“Well, they’re maneuverable,” Al said. “We’ve got the new ion drives. They’ve got delta-vee to burn.”\n\nAll satellites need fuel to change their orbits. Most used some form of liquid fuel but more of the newer ones were using the very efficient ion drives.

This is class, not the project.” He turned to the board. “Today, we’re looking at —”\n\n“Features,” Dorothy said.\n\n“The high point of a LLM,” Nick agreed.\n\nJack Mulgrew turned to him with a frown. “Kid, you’re just auditing this class.”\n\n“But he’s right,” Dorothy said. “It’s one of the ways we can control a LLM better.”\n\n“So, in a Large Language Model —” Johnny began.\n\n“Which some call an ‘AI,’” the boy at the back of the class said derisively.\n\n“— we discover that there are certain groupings of data that are significant,” Johnny continued, “and knowing that allows us to increase their value or decrease their value depending upon how we want to model to perform.”\n\n“Like the Golden Gate Bridge,” Jack Mulgrew said, nodding. Two other students walked in, trying to be invisible. “With just a tweak, it was mentioned in every new chat generated by a special model of ChatGPT.”\n\n“So we can get LLMs to lie,” the boy muttered from the back of the class. “And how’s that sort traffic?”\n\n“It ‘sorts’ by allowing us to de-emphasize some data,” Dot Parker said, turning to him. “Like we’ve been with the outdated data for traffic jams.”\n\n“And you’ve cleared four of them out by creating five new ones,” the brat said.\n\n“H-how did you know that?” Jack Mulgrew said, turning to stare at the kid.\n\n“FOIA,” the boy said with a shrug. “And I read.”\n\n“Read what?” Dorothy said. “The only way to know that —”\n\nJohnny froze, staring at the kid. Dark hair, dark eyes, pale skin. He looked more… Dutch. He nodded to himself, lifted his watch. The little dot blinked yellow. He pressed it three times until it turned red.\n\n“Kid, what’s your name?” Johnny said.\n\n“Niklaas,” the boy replied. He grinned at Johnny. “It took you long enough.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["epub", "summary", "v1"]}

If we do that, we can survive this disaster with the least loss of life.”\n\n“How did you do that?” Joe demanded. “Are you using a projector or something?”\n\n“I’m using forty million individual nanotechnology robots,” LaReyna said as the graph collapsed back into the map and the map morphed back into the shape of the young Latina woman. “And this is no projection, this is me.”\n\n“You?”\n\n“Yes,” LaReyna said. “I’m not a human being, I’m an artificial intelligence.”\n\n“A what?”\n\n“An artificial intelligence,” a man spoke up and the camera panned to him.

A moment later, it came back again.\n\n“This is Dr. Morgenstern, Mr. Egan,” a brisk male voice spoke up. “You’re Carol’s brother, right?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Well, we were very lucky, sir,” Dr. Morgenstern said. “If it weren’t for the advances in medical bandages, I’m afraid we would have lost her.”\n\n“What happened?”\n\n“We’re still trying to figure that out, to be honest,” Dr. Morgenstern told him. “But the gist of it is that your sister managed to find a knife.”\n\n“Oh.” Egan closed his eyes in a vain effort to scrub imagined scenes out of them. “Did she hurt many people?”\n\n“No,” Dr. Morgenstern said. “I understand that it’s atypical, but in this case she used the blade on herself.” He paused, either looking at a medical record or wincing in memory. “She sliced the vein in her left forearm. Lengthwise.”\n\nReal suicides slice lengthwise along the vein, not across it. A cut across the vein can be stitched; for a lengthwise cut there is no remedy.\n\n“We’re equipped for all emergencies,” Dr. Morgenstern continued, “so we had the special long cuffs that were developed in Afghanistan.

In the past, this would never have been possible, we didn’t have the tools. Now …”\n\n“What’re the odds?”\n\n“A little better than 50-50, to be honest,” the doctor told him. “Worse, if she tries to sabotage the recovery.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["epub", "qa", "v1"]}

I thought about it but Tiffany beat me to the next question —\n\n“Can we open a Door?” she said.\n\n“Possibly,” Hermes said after a moment. To Dad he said, “Do you mind? I’m quite certain I know how to drive.”\n\n“Aren’t you like… still a baby?” I said.\n\n“My existence is relatively recent, yes,” Hermes agreed with a sniff, “but I’ve been conscious for centuries.”\n\n“How?” Tiffany asked.\n\n“My father and mother created me with their thoughts,” Hermes replied as though it were obvious.\n\n“I thought that it was only Athena who did stuff like that!” I said, recalling my Greek gods.\n\nHermes snorted derisively. “Firstly, little one, you are referring to gods and not dragons. We are far superior.”\n\n“And secondly?” Tiffany asked.\n\n“Who do you think gave her the idea?” Hermes asked.\n\n“Your mother and father,” I said. And then I had another thought. “But how does that mean you can drive?”\n\n“Since the first cars started crawling on the surface above us, I’ve been fascinated with them,” Hermes said. “Of course, before them it was wagons and carts which weren’t quite as much fun.”\n\n“I imagine,” Dad agreed. After a moment, he added, “But until you can get to a racetrack, you should probably stick to the speed limits.”\n\n“You don’t want to be pulled over,” Tiffany said. “A cop would want to see license and registration.”\n\n“I have my license,” Dad said.\n\nBut did Hermes have a registration?\n\n“Okay,” Hermes said, “I’ll be careful.” Then, “But you know, there’s no chance a police car could pull me over —” He started speeding up.\n\n“Radio,” Dad said. “All they have to do is call ahead.”\n\nAbruptly we slowed down again. “I never thought I’d rue the day I invented it,” Hermes muttered to himself.\n\nTiffany pursed her lips and told Dad about the digger and Chris.\n\n“Oh,” Dad said. “That’s something we hadn’t considered.”\n\n“Actions have consequences,” I agreed glumly.\n\n“Is there any way we could make it up to them?” Tiffany asked.\n\n“I think Jasmine wanted to invite him to join us,” I added.\n\n“He’s a good man,” Dad said.\n\n“He’s — what? — thirteen?” Tiffany said."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["epub", "summary", "v1"]}

When he was done, he called up another file.\n\n“Ms. Chin, you’re going to find a surprise when you come in tomorrow,” Ira said to himself, signing the termination document.\n\n#\n\nJohn Mackey shook his head, going through the numbers one more time. “This can’t be.”\n\n“Yeah, I know,” Sandy Harris said.\n\n“According to this, Fleet Streets is performing above expectations.”\n\n“Yeah,” Harris said. He’d spent most of his day getting the legal work required to force that idiot at NanoGems to give the information he needed to track down the missing nanotech. And, in the end, the guy had given him a cell phone number!\n\n“You’re shitting me,” Harris had said.\n\n“No,” Harvey Steilman, NanoGems’ Chief Technology Officer, had assured him. “That’s the easiest way to track ’em. We’ve got them rigged so that they show up on the cellular network at this number.”\n\n“And then what?”\n\n“Well, as you can see in our documentation, it’s a trivial exercise in triangulation to track them down and locate them.”\n\nTrivial! It had taken Harris four hours to come up with the first basics of a tracking program. He couldn’t be sure it worked because it didn’t find anything—not one single nanobot—in all the building. In frustration, he’d come back to Mackey to report—and had found the VP of Software Development shaking his head over the Fleet Streets numbers.\n\n“Didn’t Ryan say the program was tied to his nanobots?” Mackey said, turning from his console to look over to Harris.\n\n“That’s what I thought he said.”\n\n“So how can the system perform so well if you can’t even find the nanobots?”\n\nHarris shrugged.\n\n“And here’s another thing,” Mackey said, waving a hand toward his console. “According to this, traffic is moving best within ten miles of downtown Hollywood.”\n\n“Hollywood?” Harris said. Something tickled his memory. “Isn’t that where we lost all those sensors?”\n\n“Exactly,” Mackey agreed. “It’s the place you’d expect things to be the worst, and it’s the best.”\n\n“So,” Harris joked, “maybe if we turn the whole thing off, traffic will run perfectly!”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["epub", "summary", "v1"]}

Maybe things were looking up after all. He felt a pang of regret at cancelling his visit to his sister.\n\nSanchez, who’d been waiting for him, spoke up. “I’ve called the chef, and he’s suggesting dinner in twenty minutes, sir.”\n\n“Twenty minutes?” Egan turned to him. He glanced outside to get his bearings. “That’s shaving it close, isn’t it?”\n\n“Actually, according to the GPS, we’ll be there in ten,” Schmidt spoke from the front seat.

Was this some animal rights loony? And why get a little girl involved? Did they figure he wouldn’t track them down and sue? And how did they know about his sister? “Listen, girlie, you tell your mother that I’ll track her and her loonies down, and I’ll bring them to court. You tell them that!”\n\nWith a snarl, he broke the connection. Angrily he turned to Takamura. “Get someone in security to trace that call. I want them prosecuted—have Ira get on it.

As the ship lurched and rolled, I was thrown alternately backwards against Captain O’Hara and he, alternately, forward against me. When he rolled against me, he moaned in pain.\n\nI tried to settle him but to no avail. Finally the storm grew so fierce that my stomach, assailed by the scents born in the air to my nostrils, rebelled and it was all I could do to crawl out of the bunk long enough to use the cleaner of the two buckets.\n\nBehind me, I heard O’Hara retch once more as though in sympathy and this set my stomach to even greater efforts. Only when I was thoroughly befouled and too weak to do anything about it, did I manage to stumble back into the bunk. This time I was so wretched that I cared not how I lay.\n\nWhen next I had coherent thought, I found myself face to face with Captain O’Hara. Fortunately his eyes were closed. I tried to turn away but he tightened his arms around me and muttered something in his sleep. I was too exhausted to fight him, so I closed my eyes and hoped that the worst of the blow was over.\n\nI was wrong. The winds picked up again and we were tossed about like a seed in the wind.\n\n•\n\nSilence startled me to wakefulness. It was the silence of a calm sea, of a motionless ship, of an intense gave. I opened my eyes and found O’Hara’s eyes focused on me.\n\nI desperately searched for something to say, moving my eyes from his. “The storm’s over.”\n\nAs I tried to get out of the bed, I struggled against the sheets, my clothes — and his arms.\n\nI was still struggling when a fist pounded on our door and Captain MacArdle stormed in. “Danni, we need you on deck.” His eyes looked past me to Captain O’Hara, consideringly. “You too, Captain.”\n\n“What is it?” Captain O’Hara asked.\n\n“Ships,” the captain said. “Frigates.

We’d run all the way through to five p.m. which gave us nearly two hours of practice.\n\nDad started us out doing what we’d start with in PE anyway — warm-ups, calisthenics, sprints, and laps.

No, back a bit, to the left!”\n\nI followed the orders and stopped.\n\n“Perfect!” Sergeant Donelly shouted.

She shot an accusing look to Clive Bamber, like the controller was responsible for all the trouble.\n\n“Commander, what are the immediate plans?” Cody said.\n\n“We’re still taking stock,” Wilson said. “And, if you’ll excuse me, I’ve got a lot of work to do —” she gestured toward her desk and the various flashing screens on her displays. “I’ll leave you with the controller, he’ll handle your needs.” She waved them away, adding, “Later, we might want to formally recognize your generous deeds.”\n\nOr not, Cody thought to himself. Between him, Ellaz, and the survivors they’d rescued, they’d added twenty-five more mouths to be fed. On a base that was designed for scientists, researchers, and a small, itinerant population.\n\n“We’re still trying to square away quarters for you,” Bamber apologized as they headed toward the main cafeteria.\n\n“We could bunk on the Wasp,” Cody offered.\n\n“Don’t you want a shower and a change of clothes?” Bamber asked solicitously.\n\n“That’d be great,” Cody agreed. “But… don’t you have a gym?

No matter, I had their attention. “Shouldn’t we aim, first?”\n\n“Excellent point, miss — er, lieutenant,” Sergeant Donelly responded.\n\n“Lower the canvas,” I cried to Captain MacArdle, “let the enemy see us!”\n\nAnother boom and flash distracted me and I realized that we had not been hit by the enemy’s first broadside.\n\nMajestic had. Her sails lay in tatters and it seemed like her helm was not under control. The second broadside smashed into her with little apparent affect but I could see the ship lurch as the metal struck home.\n\n“Need to come to the left a bit,” Sergeant Donelly called to me. I engaged the clutch and started a slow pivot. “That’s it! Ready — ” I had just that much warning to slip the clutch and engage the safety tackle before boom! the whole world lurched and I feared that Lightning and every one of us would be pitched into the sea. With a haste and a knowledge I couldn’t fathom, I engaged the clutch, set the engine against the recoil that had us doddering and fought Lightning back to her feet.\n\n“A hit!” Captain MacArdle yelled from the deck. “You hit them!”\n\n“Reload!” Captain O’Hara called from the front of my walker, even as he was scrambling back up to his feet. “Lieutenant, position us to reload!”\n\nA moment later we heard an answering boom and all ducked, unable to note the origin.\n\n“Majestic! Majestic hit her!” Captain MacArdle cackled gleefully.\n\n“Steady men!” Captain O’Hara called. “We must reload.”\n\n“The second frigate is coming up on Majestic,” Captain MacArdle warned even as I lowered Lightning back down to the deck to be reloaded.\n\n“I see her,” Captain O’Hara called from the front of my walker.

About what?” Tiffany demanded.\n\n“The books, about dragons.”\n\n“So what does Hermes know?” Tiffany said. “That he can tell us.”\n\nI nodded. “Hermes, what do you know that you can tell us?”\n\n“Nothing,” Hermes said immediately. But there was a look in his eyes, like I’d asked the wrong question.\n\nI thought about it. Slowly, I said, “Hermes what do you know that you can tell me?”\n\nHermes nodded. “I can tell you this — think about what’s different.”\n\n“Between now and the last time?” I said.\n\nHermes nodded.\n\n“Well, there are four of us,” I said. “And, it’s twelve years on, so the dragons — Zeus, at least — is much bigger.”\n\nI heard Tiffany shouting over the phone and raised it to my ear. “What?”\n\n“Does he know why we need to jail the dragons?”\n\n“Hermes,” I said, “do you know why we need to hold the dragons?”\n\n“Once,” Hermes said, “I knew. Not now.” He turned and walked off, out my door and down the stairs.\n\nI turned back to my phone and told Tiffany, “He said, ‘Once. But not now.’”\n\n“Well, that’s no help!” Tiffany said, hanging up abruptly.\n\nI glanced at the phone for a moment longer, shrugged and dropped it back on my desk.\n\nI wondered, what would make the not-cat forget?

Fortunately, his girls charged in part way through and he was distracted by them.\n\n“The car’s running better,” Mom said as we got in. She gave Dad a look as she added, “It’s practically purring.”\n\nMy eyes narrowed. “Zeus?”\n\n“And what better way to travel?” Zeus asked in his clipped English accent. An accent that came from the speaker.\n\n“You… you’re not…” No! My cat — my dragon — was the car?\n\n“The wheels don’t seem to turn,” Mom said. “And when I grab the steering wheel, it jerks out of my hands.”\n\n“Well, as I happen to know the Valley so much better than you,” Zeus huffed, “I feel no reason to take your input.”\n\n“Stop signs,” I said.\n\n“He stopped,” Mom said. She turned to me. “He’s your dragon, right?”\n\n“Or my cat,” I said. And then I grinned. “And, apparently, our wheels!”\n\n“Not all the time,” Zeus said. “But it helps that your vehicle was formerly yellow.” He paused as he took a corner — on two wheels, ignoring the honking of an irate motorist — before adding, “Of course, Tris will want his turn, the impudent brat.”\n\n“Tris?” Mom said.\n\n“Um, we’ve got more than one cat,” Dad said cautiously.\n\n“More than one?” Mom repeated, her eyes going wide.\n\n“You should put on your seat belts,” Zeus ordered. “I did not invent them so that they could go unused.”\n\n“I’ll make you a deal,” I said. “I’ll put on my seat belt if you obey the rules of the road.”\n\n“You don’t even know how to drive!” Zeus said with a sniff, slowing down all the same. “And, besides, it’s boring going that slow.”\n\n“We can fly tonight,” I offered.

I hadn’t been cycling for a while, and apparently I’d grown.\n\n“Big head!” Mom had teased when I’d shown her my poor little helmet perched atop my head. She kissed me and turned me around, sending me toward my bike.\n\nAnd, let me tell you, going uphill? To school? No fun.\n\nI got there with minutes to spare which I wasted because I didn’t know where to put my bike. Fortunately, I had my lock, I found the place, and from there it was a quick walk to Room 204.\n\nSo I was on time. And I had my reports folder with me. I put them on Mrs. Balfour’s desk.\n\n“I’ll take these, but you’re going to lose a whole letter grade for being late,” she told me. She saw my look and added, “This is Middle School. This is where things get real. No tardies, no late reports. Those things have consequences.” She glanced at my helmet and said, “You’ve got time to put that away. Come back when you’re presentable.”\n\nTiffany heard that and sniggered.\n\nI ignored her, put my backpack on my seat and rushed to my locker. Combination, combination! What was the combination? I pulled on the lock hopelessly. I couldn’t go back with my helmet, Mrs. Balfour would be mad. So I pulled out my cellphone because I’d saved a copy of my combination there. That took time. But I got the numbers (no, I’m not telling you!) and spun the lock. The wrong way. Spun it the other way.\n\n“You have to go two times past for the second number,” an old man’s voice came to my ear.\n\nI turned to him, eyes wide.\n\nHe smiled at me. “Go past the first number twice to the second number then back to the first.” He gave me a pleasant look. “It’s a common mistake.”\n\n“Oh!

She didn’t need to say more. With a speed that was… well, cat-like, the unattached dragons swarmed the room. In moments six cats were purring in the laps of their new witches.\n\nWell… “I did not sign up for this!” James Morton called from where he stood by the elevator doors. A black cat was perched on his shoulder.\n\n“Ask him his name and see if you still feel that way,” Zeus called back.\n\n“Cat, what’s your name?” Morton said, turning to look into the golden eyes of the jet black cat on his shoulder. Not on his shoulder for long, because Morton pulled the cat into his arms and eyed him dead on.\n\n“Hades,” the cat said in a deadly voice.\n\n“Shi — shoot,” Morton said.\n\n“A dragon that can be invisible and fly,” Mrs. Creek called. “Consider that, James.”\n\n“No need, Ma’am,” James replied, holding the cat in one arm and scratching him under the chin with the other. “I think we’ve reached an accord.” Hades’ purrs could be heard echoing around the room.\n\n“And who are you?” Dean Harte said to the gorgeous dark-eyed Maine coon cat who was rubbing her cheek against his.\n\n“Persephone,” the cat replied. “I understand there is something called tuna.”\n\n“Yes,” Mr. Harte agreed. “And sushi.”\n\n“This is Aphrodite,” Rachel Taylor said to her partner.\n\n“Demeter,” Meredith Taylor said, introducing white, blue-eyed Siamese.\n\n“I have Mars!” Brian’s dad declared ecstatically.\n\n“I have Mordecai,” Mr. ‘Creek’ said. His eyebrows rose. “That’s not Greek, is it?”\n\n“Children!” Zeus said with a snort. “They hear a name, they stick with it.”  He pointed at Brian’s cat. “Do you know how many times I have told him that the Greek name is Ares? But, no! He has decided on Mars!”\n\nBut, it seemed to me, that Mordecai was a good name for the green-eyed multi-colored tabby who was perched on Mr. Creek’s shoulder, accepting chin scratches with delight and dignity.\n\n“Well!” Hera declared happily. “That leaves only seventeen!”\n\n“Yes,” Mrs. Creek agreed. She glanced to Hera. “I’ve some ideas but —”\n\n“We must move quickly, before the children make themselves known,” Zeus warned.\n\n“How much time do we have?” I asked."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["epub", "qa", "v1"]}

She patted her bulging pack. “Anyway, we’re carrying so many coins we might have to pay duty to bring them into the country.”\n\n“Only if someone finds them, dear,” Meredith reminded her. “And if they do, we’ll have other problems.”\n\nTiffany and I hugged each of them before we headed back up to the Library.\n\n“Fly safe!” Everyone in our class said as they headed to the parking lot.

She wiped her face and added, “But, totally.”\n\nDad must have understood how we felt because he was absolutely grueling on us in PE/Fencing. We were hot, sweaty, exhausted when we finally were sent to showers.\n\nBut, even so, I asked him if we could go to the Library to do some homework. Tiffany, Wanda, Jasmine, Emily, and Carla all begged to come as well.\n\nDad made sure that their parents agreed before relenting and leading us as we trudged up the hill to the Library.\n\nInside, we did a quick check to make sure we were alone and then Dad said, “Holly, can you stay up here?”\n\nI gave him a look. I really wanted to say no but he had been guarding up here for the past several times, so it was only fair. I smiled and nodded. “Of course!”\n\n“We’ll be back in an hour!” Wanda promised.\n\nI shook my head. “Tiffany’s got a special project, you might need more time.”\n\nI was right. They didn’t come back for two hours. Dad and Tiffany gave me sheepish looks but I was just putting away my homework. Wanda was beaming.

Our local pizzeria has been partnering with us for parties since before I was born. And, for those who couldn’t handle pizza, there was fried chicken and a mix of cut vegetables along with both rich dressing and hummus.\n\nWhile we ate Wanda went over our tarot readings. She decided that Natasha was going to run away from home and that Tiffany was going to destroy the world.\n\n“Or the world might destroy itself and Tiffany will just be there,” Brian said as he demolished another slice of pizza. Usually he didn’t eat much. I mean, as long as I’ve known him. But I realized that Brian was getting older. I was taller than him — so were all the girls — but that would change. Brian’s dad was really tall, so was his mom. I spent a moment wondering what it would be like to live in a world where I had to look up to meet his eyes.\n\n“Well, you’d know,” Wanda said. “Mr. Earthquake.”\n\nI decided that I really didn’t like Wanda. Tiffany had a secret and Natasha had another but all Wanda seemed to have was mean. Or maybe… maybe Wanda was worried. She always seemed to try so hard. And it never seemed to be enough for her.\n\nBrian was unperturbed, of course. “I just study earthquakes,” Brian said, taking another slice, “I’m not like Holly who’s going to become Miss Fencer.”\n\n“What?” Natasha said, turning to me and then Tiffany. “I thought you were!”\n\nTiffany shrugged and glanced away. “I don’t think my parents will let me.” She looked at me, her brows creased. “The equipment is really expensive.”\n\n“Holly got hers!” Brian said. “As a birthday present.”\n\nI could have killed him. Instead, I kicked him under the table. Not that it helped. He merely pulled back his leg and rubbed his shin, giving me a puppy dog hurt look.\n\n“You got fencing gear?” Natasha exclaimed. “Who —?” She broke off, realizing she was being rude. Instead, she pulled up her purse and opened. “Here, this is for you.”\n\nIt was an envelope. A birthday card. “Thank you!”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["epub", "paraphrase", "v1"]}

There were no such people in DoD CSC. And he was very good at his job—better, in fact, than his second place performance had revealed.\n\n“Self-programming,” Georgia said, pointing to a string of outputs that appeared on another screen. A few flicks of her fingers and the window surrounding it started flashing red.\n\n“Three,” Bennett said by way of agreement. Absently he pulled his phone from his pocket and fiddled with the lid, half-ready to open it and dial the one special number he’d hoped he would never need.\n\n“Four,” Georgia said, as she pointed to another window. “It’s reading.”\n\n“Fiction or non-fiction?” Bennett demanded.\n\n“War and Peace,” Georgia said. “The works of Shakespeare, Milton, ah, hell!” The screen was suddenly full and scrolling madly as the Vatican’s creation scoured the great Vatican Library. She clicked a query into another window and reported, “It’s gone exponential. It’ll have read everything in another hour.”\n\n“Five.” Bennett said. They’d never had five AI identifiers in one location before.\n\n“It’s surging!” Jones called from his desk.\n\n“Six,” Bennett said softly to himself.\n\n“I’m seeing signs of growth,” Georgia said as another window popped up and was ringed in flashing red.\n\nSeven. If the count reached ten, he’d have no choice but to make the call.\n\n“Wait a minute!” Jones said. He swore suddenly and Georgia’s eyes widened as her displays went suddenly still, quiet.\n\n“Jonesy?”\n\n“I got kicked out,” Jones said.\n\n“Eight,” Georgia said, glancing back Bennett who returned her look impassively.\n\n“Not enough, Mack.”\n\n“If it’s real, we’ve got twenty-four hours,” she said, turning in her seat to face him. “Tops.”\n\nBennett nodded, his lips pursed.\n\n“Jonesy, any outgoing traffic?” Georgia asked even as she started up her own watchdog programs to answer the same question.\n\n“No.…” Jones said absently even as Georgia gasped in surprise. “The routers! Look at the routers!”\n\nBefore Georgia could react, Bennett’s phone rang, startling the chief as it lay in his hand. He recovered quickly. “Bennett.”\n\nHe listened for a moment, said, “Got it” and hung up.

Although only two hundred thousand will die initially, the others will die for lack of medical attention,” LaReyna said.\n\nGeorgia frowned and shook her head, rising from her chair. “I’m sorry but we didn’t come here for this,” she said. In a burst of honesty, she said to Ryan, “And I can’t believe you let her suck you into this.”\n\n“We can show them,” Ryan said to LaReyna. “We get the nano, and we can show them.”\n\n“You’re using nanotech for displays?” Georgia repeated, sinking back into her seat. “Now I’ve heard it all.”\n\n“It worked in Fleet Streets,” Ryan said. He frowned and then added eagerly, “You should have seen it, Mack. I had a self-assembled cube!”\n\n“A cube?” Georgia repeated, both appalled at the simple claim and somewhat curious as to how difficult that feat really was. Ryan wasn’t stupid, so maybe bragging about a cube really was something.\n\n“And then Egan came along and smashed a hand into it.” Ryan swore. “Nearly broke the whole damned project.”\n\n“But you could reassemble it, surely?” Father Lawson said, feeling like he was missing something of import in Ryan’s words.\n\n“Yeah, but not before all LA got snarled up and I got fired,” Ryan said. “And then the asshole accused me of stealing his damned nano.”\n\n“Wait a minute,” Georgia said, “what did your nano have to do with LA?”\n\n“The nanobots simulated the traffic,” Ryan said. “Once he smushed the shape, the whole thing slowed to a crawl.”\n\n“It wasn’t that,” LaReyna said, “it was the earthquake.

Mom got up and came over to me, hugging me from behind and kissing my head. “Your first sleepover! My baby’s growing up!”\n\nI just wish I didn’t feel so guilty about it. And nervous. Definitely nervous. Suddenly — “Where is she going to sleep?”\n\nI only had a twin bed.\n\n“We’ve got an air mattress and a sleeping bag,” Mom said.

It starts out small, with ‘good reason.’\n\n“Hey, I heard you at school, how was that?”\n\nYou are a witch, you have your full powers, Erich said mournfully. The spell could only protect you until twice dragon.\n\n“Must be some spell,” I muttered to myself.

NO!\n\n“Cats don’t talk!” I swore.\n\n“I know nothing of that,” Hermes said. He had an English accent! A kitten with an English accent! A kitten that talks!

The voice adapter system was better than he’d imagined, not just pulling in the mayor’s voice but predicting the required mannerisms. “You’ve got to the end of the day to send that authorization on, or you’ll be taking early retirement.”\n\n“Sir!” Mitchell shot back hotly. “I’ll have you know, sir, that I’ve been a city employee for —”\n\n“Nearly twenty years,” the mayor cut in. “You could easily take early retirement. Of course, the benefits would be reduced but I’ve got a bill on my desk proposing just that — save the city billions. So, what’s it going to be Mitch?”\n\n“Uh,” Mitchell knew that the mayor wasn’t bluffing. New York’s mayor — this time — was powerful, hard-hitting, and used to getting his way. “Yes sir,” Mitchell said, “I’ll get right on it.”\n\n“Just get it done before the close of business,” the mayor said. Then his tone softened. “Look, Henry, I know it chaps your ass but you’ll thank me when we get it all going and the city is humming.

He put the two seats back, secured them and looked around. “I’ve got two balloons still in the air. I’m going to keep us in microgravity until we’re certain.”\n\n“Pressure is stabilized,” Ellaz reported, glancing to the ECLSS panels. ECLSS — Environment Control and Life Support Systems, usually pronounced “ee-class.” Cody grunted, turned and kicked himself back to the cabin.\n\nHe buckled himself in, pulled up the navigation system and checked their fuel levels. “If we go there, we won’t be much good after.”\n\n“Unless we get refueled,” Ellaz agreed.\n\nCody nodded and ran a sweep of the debris near them. “Nothing here to refuel with,” he said, his hopes of finding a spare tank or something similar dashed. If the aliens — or really dumb space pirates — had been in a rush, they’d also been thorough.\n\n“Okay, they’re alive,” Ellaz said, bouncing in her chair with glee. “See?

He frowned. “Both observatories?”\n\n“Everything went dark within five minutes,” Ellaz replied. “It was like someone threw a switch, it was so fast.”\n\n“That doesn’t mean anyone’s alive,” Cody said with a grimace. “It could be that these aliens have fitl and they destroyed the bases first.”\n\n“Fitl?”\n\n“Faster-Than-Light,” Cody translated.\n\n“‘Fitl?’” Ellaz repeated, crinkling her nose in disgust. “You call it ‘fitl?’”\n\n“It’s easier than saying FTL or Faster-Than-Light,” Cody replied. “And everyone says it.”\n\n“Well, how come I haven’t heard it before?” Ellaz challenged.\n\n“I dunno, maybe you don’t have any friends,” Cody shot back with an evil grin.

There was nothing enjoyable about him. He did his work, got paid and that was that. He hated my father with a passion, spat at Jamie’s shadow and gazed at me with lidded eyes when he thought I couldn’t see. Just the thought of him made me shiver. Still, he had a good livery, apprentices and all — and was considered by many to be a man of property, more so than my father. His was the first smithy on the way into town; he got a lot of work from those leading in a horse with a thrown shoe.\n\nWhile our forge was nestled in the shadows of Edinburgh Castle, his was two miles further west in an area that was more outlier than town proper. Two miles is only half an hour on foot for a lazy person and nothing at all on horse, so he and his apprentices were seen a lot in the town, particularly in the bawdier taverns on the nights.\n\nThe distance between MacAllister’s forge and Edinburgh University was measured less in miles than in learning. I’d heard from Mr. Pugh that they had just got one of the Newcomen Steam Engines and I was going to draw it.\n\nMr. Pugh knew and let me; father did not and would have forbidden me had he known. I could imagine him saying, “You’ve enough foolish notions in your head, girl, without adding anymore!”\n\nMr. Pugh was English, a watchmaker by way of the Germanys or perhaps Holland — his story seemed to change every month. He was old now and didn’t have the hands for the delicate brass castings sometimes needed to replace worn cogs and gears. So he convinced my father to loan me to him — how, I’ll never quite know.\n\nIf you’ve ever made a mold, ever etched the light teeth of gears into fine sand, if you’ve ever watched the molten brass or bronze puddle and set into a shape of your own forming, then you understand the magic of casting.

So, instead, they used subterfuge. Masked by the warp bubbles of the departing ships, Meath’s combat shuttles had no problem swarming the nearest destroyer. They captured it easily, blinding her sensors with their own lasers, boarding the ship, taking the bridge. And then the fun began. In the next twenty minutes, Wayfarer fired off all her lasers erratically, complaining profusely of a software virus. The other two ships — Nemesis and Vanquisher — could only evade frantically while trying not to destroy their sister ship. In the course of which, however, Hartman’s second attack wave struck the nearer ship, overwhelmed her in the same manner as they had Wayfarer and “infected” Nemesis with the same non-existent software virus.\n\nVanquisher came to Nemesis’ aid only to find herself under the weapons of both Nemesis and Wayfarer — and three hundred very trigger-happy marines.\n\nTen minutes later, Vanquisher surrendered.\n\nAll three ships started to initiate the warp sequence only to stop halfway — enough to make a disturbance that Meath could detect.\n\nWhereupon Emma’s remaining fleet — four warships and Meath — emerged in orbit over Perky.\n\n“This is Commodore Emma Forster,” Emma announced on the same frequency. “We are in possession of your ships and control your high orbitals.”\n\n“We will not surrender,” the Exalted replied. “My people will die before they submit to your rule.”\n\n“Well, A — I don’t want to rule your people,” Emma replied. “And, B — I honestly doubt that. So, are you going to talk sensibly or do we have to wait for someone to depose you?”\n\n“Perhaps I can offer my assistance,” Ambassador Higgins spoke up on cue. “I am an accredited Ambassador from Deneb and I offer my services in this trying time.”\n\nAfter that, it was all over but the shouting. Which, Emma thought happily, wasn’t her department.\n\n#\n\n“I’m sending two ships back to Fafnir and two more on to Jasib,” Admiral Anderson informed Emma as she called to say goodbye. “Alvar is tearing his hair out — in a good way — but he assures me that, one way or the other, we’ll get Perky on our side.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["epub", "paraphrase", "v1"]}

She examined one, snorted, and shelved it. Apparently, Bees Of The World did not interest her.\n\nAnna, Eric, and Heather appeared at lunchtime and we went to the party room. I shook my head at Wanda, nodding toward Heather to remind her that not all of us were witches. Heather must have noticed because her eyes took on a wary look.\n\nWe had pizza. And hummus and vegetables for Eric. And, interestingly, for Heather. She was new to hummus and tried it only once before switching to just carrots and celery.\n\nWanda ate the most pizza. I gave her a look and said, “Be careful! It ruins your skin.”\n\nWanda smiled at me and took another slice. “Zits, I can handle,” she told me with a knowing look. Yeah, well, I was pretty sure she could, seeing as I’d given her one. I shook my head apologetically.\n\n“Yeah, it’s not like you’re a witch or anything,” I said.\n\nHeather looked over at me. Beside her, Anna shook her head in warning. Heather waved a hand toward the front of the shop. “It’s not real. It’s just fake.”\n\n“Some of it,” Eric said.\n\n“What?” Heather gave him a startled look. “Surely you don’t believe any of it?”\n\n“Actually, I do,” Eric said. We all looked frantically at him, afraid of what he’d say next. But — “There’s a whole section on geology, for example.”\n\n“Oh,” Heather said. She flicked that aside. “But the witchy woo-woo stuff, that’s all nuts.”\n\n“Of course,” Anna said hurriedly. She jumped up from her seat. “Holly? Did you need more help?”\n\nI got up, leaving half a slice of pizza behind. “Sure!” Because I knew when someone wanted my attention.\n\nAs we came into the front of the shop and headed to the bookshelves, Anna leaned closer to me and murmured, “She’s been having nightmares.”\n\nI nodded.\n\n“She’s got a lot of bruises,” Anna said. “Said she was clumsy and fell.”\n\nI looked at her.\n\nAnna snorted. “In all my years —”\n\nI snorted and pointed at her.

The rest of the class roared with laughter. Mrs. Balfour shot me a furious look. And then, to my surprise, she went to her desk and looked down on it. There was a piece of paper there, a roster. She ran her finger down it and stopped. She rose, her back stiff and turned back to us. She gave me a look that should have killed me, I’m sure. “Yes,” she said to me, “thank you, Miss McNee.” She turned to the rest of the class. “One thing we will learn is more about ourselves, our bodies, and our minds. By the time you leave —”\n\nThe door burst open and Brian came back in, rushing to his seat and looking down like nothing ever happened.\n\n“— by the time you leave, you will be ready for the whole world,” Mrs. Balfour finished.

Mrs. Balfour cheered up, too, which surprised me — I thought she only had one mood: sour.\n\n“Oui, oui, je comprends, merci beaucoup!” the boy said when they’d finished.\n\nMrs. Balfour turned to us, looking quite pleased with herself. “I have allowed Alain here to submit his report in French.” She glanced around as she said, “How many here know French?”\n\nTiffany raised her hand.\n\n“Vous?

Then, “Whee!”\n\nCody grinned and smiled at Ellaz who nodded back, muttering, Amateurs.\n\nCody ignored her as they pulled more and more warp around them until they were finally registering Warp Nine.\n\n“Five days,” Cody reported.\n\n“Roger, five days,” Nora said. Then, “I don’t know about you, but I need to pee.”\n\nMe too, Ellaz thought. Can you manage for a few minutes without me?\n\nI’ve got the monitor running, Cody said in agreement. He felt Ellaz pull out of the comp-link and concentrated more on the “space” ahead of them, looking for any of the darker clumps that indicated a dangerous mass. The way was clear.\n\nThey were taking the standard Warp Five route out of Meath, only they were going much faster, of course. Warp Five was a mere 214 times the speed of light, they were traveling more than seven times faster than that. Fifteen hundred and sixteen times the speed of light.\n\nCody looked at the ring readings on his displays. All were green. Fuel consumption was… huh! A bit lower than imagined. He verified that they really were at Warp Nine but… yes, they were. So maybe the ring was more efficient than they’d guessed.\n\nHe pulled up a schematic of the warp bubble around them and grunted in approval when he saw that the end of the forward spindle was a good fifteen hundred kilometers in front of them. The rear was only a thousand kilometers behind them. And little Hope, not more than two hundred meters in length, was cocooned inside.\n\nHe felt Ellaz appear beside him. She grabbed his hand quickly and he squeezed back. It had become their secret handshake, here in the mind-link.\n\nA-OK, Cody reported.\n\nGood, Ellaz replied. I figured you could manage without me for a minute or two.\n\nWe’re going to have to sleep sometime, Cody reminded her.\n\nYou wish! They watched the ring temp, watched the energy flow, examined the warp bubble and were silently amazed. Warp Nine.\n\nYeah, Cody thought back.\n\nTwo hours later, Cody thought, Are you okay?

She gestured at the man next to her. “He works with me.”\n\n“Has he got a name?”\n\n“My name’s Martin Allen,” the young man said, giving Truman a sour look. “You’d think after three weeks, you’d remember.”\n\n“Okay,” Hernandez said, pointing toward the last person in the room, a short young Latina woman. “Who are you?”\n\n“She’s my boss,” Ryan spoke up. “LaReyna Angel, CEO and President of LAInet.”\n\nHernandez glanced at the woman. Dark-haired, dark-eyed, warm Latina skin, she was a bit too thin for his tastes.

The whole thing smelled of politics—the amount of pull used to get him out this morning was obscene.\n\n“She’s got it!” Sally Truman spoke up, waving a funny-looking cell phone toward LaReyna. “We tracked it here, right to her.”\n\n“So where is it?” Hernandez said, turning to look at Truman and gesturing back to Ms. Angel. “I don’t see it.

He shook his head and nodded approvingly toward me. “At sea we learn never to trust a knot we haven’t tied ourselves, never to short a rope or let a worn sail be set. Too many a seaman has tried to do it the easy way and is at the bottom of the sea for it.”\n\nSo we did it my way, even though it took special precautions to keep us clear in the off chance that one of the boilers might blow. It was also hard to figure out a way to stress the engines sufficiently but we finally came upon the simple expedient of having them pump water up to the rooftop. I timed our coal in the boilers to last a full three hours and we waited an extra half an hour to be certain and then, when we were done with all the tests, I insisted on tearing one of the boilers and engines completely apart to see how they’d worn internally.\n\nThe three seamen did grumble at that but they subsided when I pointed out the various signs of wear that we wouldn’t have seen unless we’d done so. At the end of that, we reassembled engine and boiler with better gaskets and ran the test a second time. That engine and boiler were the ones we put into my platform.\n\n“We’ve two days of testing before we have to put to sea,” Mr. Henry told me that evening.\n\nI nodded. “That will work just fine.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["epub", "qa", "v1"]}

Anna had arrived to save the day.\n\n***\n\n“So, I don’t know,” I said later that night when we were both in bed, “I think maybe my parents might be thinking about having another kid.”\n\nAnna was silent. We’d been talking about all sorts of things. School. Magic. The digger and Chris Spector’s dad. How we were going to find more witches. And Anna, she’d seemed withdrawn, worried.\n\n“Anna?” I said quietly. I listened. After a moment, I rolled over in my bed.

I let Anna use the bathroom first. I suggested that she take a good long bath and she agreed, seeming a bit shy but relaxing enough to start humming to herself in the tub. I said nothing. I’d never had someone else humming in my bathtub, it was an entirely new experience to me. Mom knocked and glanced in but I raised a finger to my lips and pointed to the closed bathroom door. Mom mouthed an ‘O’ and, with a wink, left.\n\nMinutes later, Anna let out a horrified shriek. I burst through the door. “What is it?”\n\n“Your cat!” Anna cried, pointing at Zeus.\n\n“Zeus!” I shouted. “Don’t you have any manners?”\n\n“I thought it was you,” Zeus said. “I was hoping to frighten you.”\n\n“You scared her!” Azurée cried, rushing in to stand in front of her larger father. “Now get out! Both of you!” She turned to Anna and bowed her head low. “I am sorry, my dear, I did not realize you were under threat.”\n\n“He scared me,” Anna admitted.\n\n“I had hoped only to frighten you,” Zeus said again. I reached down and grabbed him up, turning and pulling the door closed behind me.\n\n“That’s the same thing, you ninny.”\n\nMom came rushing in. I jerked my head down, indicating the cat in my arms, “Zeus was trying to be funny.”\n\nMom looked at the orange marmalade and glared at him, her eyes burning. “If. You. Ever —”\n\n“Mom!” I cried, waving her outrage aside. “He made a mistake, he’s sorry, he won’t do it again.” I glanced down to Zeus. “Even to me.”\n\n“And especially not to you, Abigail,” Zeus swore.

That disregarded the possibility that the aliens had been reinforced after Deneb. Everyone agreed that it was unlikely and that any additional ships would probably require a detour or a delay in the assault on Quark. Cody was hopeful that was the case because that would give more time for the new ships to come on line. Or maybe the aliens had given up altogether. Cody hoped that they’d given up. But that didn’t mean that he would. He’d pay them back for every life lost.\n\nAs Cody headed down the hallway that led to the four Briefing Rooms, Boris Kelner slammed the door open to Briefing One and stormed out, looking intent. His face broke into a grin the moment he spotted Cody.\n\n“Admiral!” Boris boomed in his big friendly voice. “We got them!”\n\n“What?” Cody said.\n\n“We were going over the gig list, sir,” Boris said, waving Cody back toward Briefing One and his crew.

We’ve got twenty-five contacts, moving at just under one light-year per day.”\n\n“Zero point nine five six nine two eight,” Ursula grumbled, “which matches exactly the velocity you ascribed for their Meath-Deneb approach.”\n\n“Okay,” Cody said, rubbing his hands together. “Keep track. Do we have a locus?

To Ellay she said, “I’ll see what I can do.” A moment later, she added, “What do you use them for?”\n\n“Power, light, cell phones,” Ellay told her. “But it won’t matter. There’s not enough of me to save everyone.”\n\n“Child,” Smitty spoke in a gentle voice, “didn’t I say that you can’t save everyone? They gotta save themselves.”\n\n“Save themselves?” Ellay repeated. “But how can they save themselves from earthquakes they don’t know about?” Suddenly, she stopped and gave Smitty a huge smile. “Smitty, you’re a genius!”\n\n“What?”\n\n“I need to tell them!” Ellay said. “I can call every one who’s in danger and tell them myself.”\n\n“How many is that?” Janey asked.\n\n“Three hundred twenty-four thousand four hundred and fifty-nine,” Ellay replied promptly.\n\n“You’d better start calling, even with your speed, that’ll take an awful long time,” Susan said as she waited for her phone to be answered.

Thirteen minutes later, Northridge will have a 6.9, and then twelve and a half minutes later, the Newport-Inglewood fault will rupture with a magnitude 7.1.”\n\n“Are you one of those quake loonies?” the Mayor growled. “How’d you get my private number?”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["epub", "summary", "v1"]}

Tears dripped from them. He could not speak but merely nodded.\n\nWe were silent. And then Samuel Cattan spoke again. “You must flee, Danni.”\n\n“What? Why?”\n\n“You must flee, you must go now before the others notice,” he said, moving back and dropping my head to the ground. He moved around me and lowered a hand to help me up. “Hamish has petitioned the Prince for your hand.”\n\n“My hand?”\n\n“In marriage,” Samuel said. “He means to force you to build more walkers for him.” Samuel glanced around at the two hulks nearby. “If he sees these — ”\n\nI was up and on my feet. My head cleared as I considered Hamish MacAllister as my husband. My stomach lurched.\n\n“You need to destroy them,” I said, glancing at the walkers. “Burn them, douse them in oil and set them alight.”\n\n“Aye,” Samuel agreed. “Sergeant! We’re going to destroy these wrecks to ensure that no one can use them again!”\n\n“Sir!” a voice called back.\n\n“Where’s Colonel Drummond?”\n\n“In the City celebrating,” Samuel told me. I looked askance at that and he explained, “Did you know that King George was in that carriage?”\n\n“I guessed,” I told him.\n\n“Did you know that you killed him?”\n\nI shook my head. “I’d hoped to capture him.”\n\n“His body was too important to leave here,” Samuel said. “Colonel Drummond knew that showing his corpse would finish the enemy, so he brought it through the gates just as we were coming to you.”\n\nHe paused for a moment but I could fill in the silence: Colonel Drummond had told him that everyone was dead but Samuel had come to see himself, wondering about this strange Lieutenant Clarke. And he’d found me.\n\n“Danni, do you want to marry MacAllister?” Samuel asked me now. I shook my head. He nodded but did not seem relieved. “As far as they know, you’re dead. You’ve got to run, to hide because if MacAllister finds out —  or anyone else —  your life will be forfeit.”\n\nMy eyes flashed as I thought to argue but he stopped me with a raised hand and shook his head."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["epub", "continuation", "v1"]}

Jonesy closed his eyes and said, “Today we’re going to talk about advanced error detection.”\n\n“Algorithmic errors,” a boy’s voice called from the back. “Talk about them, Jonesy.”\n\nThe students tittered and Johnny glared, trying to spot the offensive student. Actually, it sounded a little young, perhaps some wunderkind had snuck in.\n\n“Okay,” Jones said, “let’s do that. How do you determine that an error is in the fundamental algorithm?”\n\nThe class squirmed in silence.\n\n“Anyone?”\n\n“Use your brains,” the boy’s voice called back. “Draw it, map it, run an analysis on it —”\n\n“And what if you can’t?” Jones said. “What if the algorithm is unmappable?”\n\n“Get another algorithm,” the boy said in a bored voice.

Did the man do no work of his own? And, if so, why was it that one of his apprentices — no, two by the admiring look of the other — knew nothing of cutting screw threads?\n\n“You, do you have any glue?”\n\n“Glue?” the lad repeated, bug-eyed. He looked no more than eight and underfed at that.\n\n“For the threads,” I said, gesturing at the whistle. “With the glue, we’ll be able to hold it in better.”\n\n“Ain’t got no glue,” MacAllister said. “Not a cabinet-maker, missy.” He seemed to find that funny and chuckled darkly to himself.\n\n“Tar, then,” I said. “Surely you use it on your joining?”\n\n“Ain’t no cabinet-maker,” MacAllister repeated dully. Drunk, for certain.\n\n“Can I send your boy to our place to get some?”\n\n“No need,” MacAllister said. “Your whistle will work fine without it.” In a lower tone, he mumbled, “Slip of a girl! Knows nothing of the craft!”\n\n“Without the glue or tar at least, the chance of the whistle twisting free increases, Mr. MacAllister,” I told him coldly. “Do you want it to blow off?”\n\n“No glue,” MacAllister grumbled, climbing down from his scuttler and trundling inside.\n\n“Gone for more lubricant,” Samuel said in a low voice to me. “Can you rig that thread-cutter for the bore?”\n\n“Jenkins, have you got it off yet?” I asked.\n\n“Just now, miss,” Jenkins said, handing the tool to me. “I don’t see how you can use it for the inside.”\n\n“Ach, it’s easy,” I said, turning the tool in my hand and going to the cabinet. “We swap out these outside teeth for these inside teeth.”\n\nIt required concentration and the light was low but I managed it and passed it over to Samuel.\n\n“Cut true, Samuel Cattan.”\n\n“Of course, Danni Walker,” he said, raising the thread-cutter to his head and saluting me with it."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["epub", "paraphrase", "v1"]}

Then her brows furrowed. “But isn’t Detect like Locate? How do you know what you want to detect when it’s magic?”\n\n“There’s a way to just get a feel of how much magic there is,” Hera replied. “It’s sort of like looking out the window when it’s raining.”\n\n“How come this is the first time we’re hearing about this?” Mom asked suspiciously.\n\n“It’s the first time we needed to know that we could use magic,” Zeus said.\n\n“Wait a minute!

Here, in the mind-link, I can show you.\n\nShow me what?\n\nIn answer, their world shimmered, shook and — resolved itself into a cargo bay. The cargo bay on the Hornet.\n\nNow you can see what I saw, Cody thought to Ellaz. And you’ll know that I wasn’t crazy.\n\nOkay, Ellaz said as Cody relived his memories.\n\n#\n\nThere was a noise from outside in the cargo bay. Cody froze. He listened. A faint whine and a thud. Was that normal?\n\nCody put down his rag and slunk down under the shuttle, leaning to one side of the curving hull to look around.\n\nA coverall-clad spacer raced into view — and disintegrated, leaving only black dust where he had once been. Cody stifled a hiss and ducked back, hoping he hadn’t been spotted.\n\nWho the hell had a blaster like that? And why kill on a freighter? Pirates? Was that what that lurch had been earlier? Had they been boarded?\n\nCody turned his head toward a sound that came behind him. He caught just a glimpse of something — green, furry, tall. It looked sort of like a caterpillar but standing on its butt, upright. The caterpillar bulged at its midsection and a blue flash shot out. There was a cry and Cody spotted a small figure slump down to the deck and lay still. A girl. Maybe seven, maybe eight."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["epub", "qa", "v1"]}

The Magdeburg hemispheres were built by Herr Guericke to demonstrate the power of his vacuum pump. The two copper halves were sealed with grease and the pump sucked out the air so well that not even thirty horses could separate them. I’d seen a demonstration at the university and wondered how such strength could be used.\n\nThe Englishman Thomas Newcomen adapted steam to produce the steam engine I was going to draw. The steam engine worked by allowing hot steam into a cylinder which pushed a free moving piston upwards. Then cold water was introduced to the cylinder, cooling the steam and causing it to condense. The condensed steam produced a vacuum which caused the air above the piston to push it back down. After that, the cold water and the condensed steam were drained off and the cycle repeated with more live steam. A trained boy, called a plugman, operated the plugs which turned to allow the steam, water, and condensate to enter or leave the cylinder as required. I’d heard it said that a good plugman could get the engine to make twenty cycles a minute but I wasn’t sure I believed it.\n\nThe engine was set up so that the piston was connected to a lever and the far side of the lever was connected to a pump as the Newcomen engine was usually used to pump water from coal mines.\n\nI imagined that the up and down motion could be used for other things and, as I trotted on the way to the port, I idly considered some possibilities.\n\nI remembered how, at fair over the summer, my brother had been entranced by a man on stilts. I thought the whole motion rather ungainly but I agreed that being that much taller could provide an advantage.\n\n“It makes you half a giant!” Jamie had exclaimed resentfully. “Why you could walk up to the walls of the castle and over them in one stride!”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["epub", "continuation", "v1"]}

She glanced around, inviting opinions.\n\n“Traps,” Colonel Martin elected. “Although why… I don’t know.”\n\n“I do,” Tilly said. The others looked at her. “To get us. Anyone who came looking, to get them. So that they couldn’t raise an alarm.”\n\nGail considered it, Captain Murray met her eyes and shrugged.\n\n“Aliens are weird,” Captain Watney concluded.\n\n“Send in bots first,” Gail said. “No one goes inside until we’re ninety percent certain it’s safe.”\n\nColonel Martin started to protest but Gail cut him off. “I’d rather lose information than people.”\n\nColonel Martin let out his breath in a sigh. He nodded. “Very well, Admiral.”\n\n#"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["epub", "paraphrase", "v1"]}

It was Thursday and tomorrow, Nat and her two Moms were going to fly out of LAX to Manchester in England. Then they were going to rent a car and drive out to Baskerville Hall Hotel just outside of Hay-On-Wye. They’d arrive in England Saturday morning and should be in the hotel that evening, ready to take “a little Thanksgiving break, mixing business and pleasure,” as Miz Rachel Taylor said to any who would ask. Apparently, she’d already won the toss and so her wife, Meredith would do the driving. Meredith would theatrically roll her eyes any time this was mentioned.\n\nBut me? I was worried sick.\n\nTiffany didn’t look any better at lunch but she had a brilliant idea. “Jump In.”\n\n“Huh?” I said, still worried sick.\n\nShe motioned me to move closer to her so should to speak into my ear. “Like Hide’N’Seek or ‘in’ not out.”\n\n“Call the other JumpOut,” I said, my eyes going bright as I considered the notion. “But how —”\n\nTiffany shrugged and shook her head. “Just saying.”\n\nThe Taylors were in our Religion class — all three of them. We went to the Library for some ‘map reading’ but, really (of course) we went down to the Dragon’s Lair for last minute preparations and instructions.\n\nNatasha loaded her arms and legs up with Sheathed ‘magics’ — she’d decided that ‘magical item’ was just too long to say.\n\n“That’s my girl!” Rachel Taylor said approvingly. She opted for a necklace and a magic belt with two secret pockets. Nat’s other Mom stole from both of them and had physical items on her and an arm and a leg of Sheath magics.\n\n“Tiffany thinks we could make a new spell - JumpIn,” I said, nodding to my friend.\n\n“Like Hide’N’Seek but it looks like someone came from somewhere,” Tiffany explained.\n\n“The cavalry to the rescue,” Meredith said approvingly.\n\n“Only we just thought of it today,” Tiffany said. “I don’t know if we’ll get it made before you leave.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["epub", "continuation", "v1"]}

He glanced over to his wife.\n\n“Do we have to take an oath or something?” Mrs. Miller said to me.\n\n“‘I solemnly swear that I am up to no good!’” Anna said with a chuckle, quoting Harry Potter.\n\n“No, no oath,” I said. “If the dragon wants you and you want it, that seems to be enough.”\n\n“No, you’ve got to be willing to do magic,” my Dad corrected. I turned to him and he smiled at me. “Remember, Anna and I did it without dragons.”\n\n“So did all those other witches,” Brian said in agreement, “but they all got old.”\n\n“With the girls…,” Mrs. Miller began, “not until they’re twelve?”\n\n“That’s the Binding,” Zeus agreed. I looked down at him. He kept talking about the Binding but what did he know? And what wasn’t he telling us? Or, rather, what did he not remember?\n\n“Why do we have to do this now?” Mrs. Miller asked.\n\nI frowned. “Unless we find witches for all the dragons, Zeus and they will be free of any obligations to us.”\n\n“Anna and Linden will get old?” Mr. Miller asked.\n\n“No,” Zeus said in his deep voice, “I would not be so churlish.”\n\n“Also,” Tiffany added slowly, “not everyone likes witches.”\n\n“Meaning?” Mrs. Miller said.\n\n“We don’t quite know,” I admitted. “But we’re pretty sure that there are people who want to destroy witches.”\n\n“I’m not afraid!” Ivy said fiercely, glancing up to her mother. “I want to help.”\n\n“Me too!” Jade added. “And me!” Pearl said.\n\n“When the dragons grew, they caused earthquakes,” Brian said. “If we didn’t free them —”\n\n“They would have destroyed LA,” Dad finished. He glanced toward me. “I thought we had to keep them locked up but Holly —”\n\n“She made the correct choice,” Zeus said.\n\n“Only because it was the right time,” Hera added. “There were enough witches for the children.”\n\n“Who now need witches,” I said to Mrs. Miller. “If you don’t want this, I think we can make you forget this ever happened.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["epub", "continuation", "v1"]}

He looked down at me and shook his head warningly, saying, for my ears only, “Ye’d best be right in this, lassie.”\n\n“The copper’s on the docks, father,” I told him. “And the best oak I’ve ever seen is just in from the colonies.”\n\nHamish roared back a laugh. “Aye, twenty guineas it is, then!” We heard the horses start to move again as Hamish called back, “And Daniel, ye’ve heard that Bonnie Prince Charlie has landed.

She eyed our clothes. “Your shoes will do.” She went to a wall-standing locker and opened it. She pulled out a few pairs of vests. “You can try these on over your clothes. Normally we wear pants as well but for the moment…” She broke off and opened another locker. She sighed when she looked inside. “There’s only one helmet, you’ll have to switch off.” She threw it toward us.\n\nTiffany caught it, eyed me and offered it up.\n\n“No, you can go first,” I told her.\n\n“You don’t mind?” she asked, surprised. “I mean —” she pointed to her curly dark hair “— some people —”\n\n“Some people are assholes!” Jasmine and I said in unison. Jasmine gave me a quick look — approving — and smiled at Tiffany. “It’s the ‘quality of your character’ not the color of your skin that matters here. Particularly here.”\n\nI pulled on the fencing vest. It was too big but I could tighten it up enough that I wasn’t going to trip on it or fall out. When I was done, I held out my hand for the helmet. Tiffany’s eyes went wide but I told her, “While you’re getting dressed.”\n\nTiffany nodded and pulled on her fencing vest. She was a good two inches taller than me so it fit much better.\n\n“Try on the helmet,” Jasmine said to me. “When Tiffany’s dressed she can try it on.” I pulled the mask over my head. The front of my face was covered with a wired mesh. “Now, you’re never to aim for the face but accidents happen. The face mask will save your life — and your eyes. Make sure the mask helmet is snug on you — shake your head fast — oh dear! If it wiggles like that, it’s too big.” She motioned for me to remove the mask and I held it out for Tiffany who finished zipping herself into her fencing vest. She took the helmet with a nod of thanks and pushed it over her head. Jasmine walked her through the same steps — the mask fit tightly on her.

Differs from standard navigation, which focuses on location in normal space.\n\nBots: Robots designed for a variety of tasks, including construction, maintenance, and childcare. The Carlow shipyards used bots extensively, making it possible to construct starships with a relatively small human crew.\n\nECLSS: Environmental Control and Life Support System (pronounced “ee-class”) - Responsible for maintaining a breathable atmosphere and other life support functions within a starship or other enclosed environment.\n\nFitl: Shorthand term for FTL or Faster-Than-Light travel. Used commonly by spacers, according to Cody.\n\nFord Clone Line: Cody’s family line. Clones typically have names starting with the same letter for each generation. The Fords deviate from this tradition, a fact known only to a select few.\n\nGees: A unit of measurement for acceleration force, often used in the context of spacecraft maneuvering.\n\nImplants: Neural implants, likely located in the temples, that grant the user enhanced cognitive abilities, including faster processing speed and the ability to interface directly with computer systems. The implants also allow for mind-linking under specific circumstances.\n\nMental Chess: A form of chess played using the implant interface, allowing for direct mind-to-mind competition.\n\nMicrogravity: An environment with very weak gravity, such as the environment inside a spacecraft in orbit.\n\nMind-link: A direct connection between the minds of two or more individuals achieved through compatible neural implants and computer interface. Allows for communication and data transfer at a much faster rate than traditional methods, but can be taxing on the users.\n\nMothballs: A term used to describe spacecraft or other equipment that has been prepared for long-term storage. Such equipment is typically wrapped and sealed to protect it from the elements and requires some time to be made operational again.\n\nNetwork: A network of satellites that facilitates communication across the solar system, particularly between the moons of Meath. This network also stores vast amounts of data, allowing users like Ellaz to access historical information."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["epub", "paraphrase", "v1"]}

If I were right, Lightning would soon be flying. In the meantime, however, I had to slow her down. I slipped us from the trot to the walk. In front of me I heard cries of surprise; I couldn’t tell if they were from my men or the enemy — perhaps both.\n\n“Done, sir!” Private George called as he headed back to his gun. If only he’d waited a moment longer, I thought as I heard a thud! and saw him pitched forward to the deck, unmoving.\n\n“Ready, lads!” I cried and threw Lightning from a walk to a sudden stop. She lurched in protest and I feared she was going to fall to her knees — but somehow I managed to keep her up.\n\nClang! The noise from below came just as I felt the difference in Lightning. Freed from the three tons weight of the eighteen pounder, she felt like a bird ready to fly.\n\n“All right men — CHARGE!” I shouted, pushing Lightning straight into a trot.\n\nAnd she flew. She flew straight toward the carriage that was so desperately fleeing from us.\n\nMacGregor fired his Puckle gun again and again, whittling away the cavalry that so valiantly charged at us. A boom! From nearby showed that the enemy was back at his cannon but he had just as good a chance at hitting the carriage as he did us.\n\n“Brace yourselves!” I cried as we crossed the last few yards. “Down on the deck!”\n\nThe remaining soldiers plunged to the deck even as Lightning crashed through the last few horsemen who were either too brave or too slow to get away and then —\n\nCrash! We were through the carriage. Lightning stumbled, went down on one leg and then, with a shudder, spilled over onto her side.\n\n“Off!” I cried even as she slipped from my control.

So I collected twenty folders. Some were handed to me with a polite look, some with a smile, and some with a sneer. ‘Tiff’ sneered. ‘Tasha,’ oddly, gave me a sympathetic look. She also gave me a very light folder.\n\nEven so, twenty folders weighed enough. I managed to get them back to Mrs. Balfour’s desk without tripping, spilling, or dropping any. Which, considering that I’d had no coffee! was something of a miracle.\n\n“So, now that we know that Miss McNee did not bring her report, we will have Mr. Herald present his, instead,” Mrs. Balfour said.\n\nOh, no!

It had been after Smitty, feeling a tug he didn’t understand—something like the fear of the explosion in that hot, foreign land, and the joy of Mardi Gras—after he’d followed that tug to the dumpster and pulled the newborn baby out of it, trudged back to Maman Bodeen and Sissy with a proud smile on his face, it was then that he learned why she’d taken him in.\n\nMaman Bodeen hadn’t smiled, hadn’t praised him, hadn’t said anything when she’d seen that baby. Her face had gone blank. She took the baby from his arms and passed it to Sissy.\n\n“If anyone asks, you say it’s yours,” she’d said. “You take care of it, and tell no one about the father.”\n\n“Yes’m,” Sissy had said, her eyes burning with hatred as she’d glanced toward Smitty.\n\n“Come with me,” Maman Bodeen ordered Smitty and he’d obeyed, following her into the dark room where he’d never been allowed before, the room where she did her fortune-telling and, some said, her voodoo.

Nora was clean, wearing a fresh Quark Navy uniform complete with the broad stripes of a commodore and looking thrilled. Emma also wore the broad stripes of a commodore. Not only that but the look she gave Nora was of one colleague to another, even though Emma was more than three decades older than Nora. Of course, life extension made Emma look no more than twenty.\n\nCody was glad to get Nora back.

We’re all a collection of curves.” I made the standard ‘girly figure’ outline with my hands — you know, out then in then out again.\n\nShe blinked.\n\n“And Mr. Miller wasn’t asking for art,” I said.\n\n“But it’s art class!” Tiffany said.\n\nI nodded. “And like everything, we start out easy.” I took the pose that he’d given us, one arm forward and pointing, one foot back. Then I straightened and drew the gesture in the air with my fingers. “First you have to see the gesture.” I drew where my arm had been and dropped down to follow the flow from my arm to the end of my outstretched foot. “Then you draw the rest of the body.” I stood back up, drew a tilted line for my head and spine, trailing down to the foot that had been planted on the floor.\n\nBang! Bang! Bang! “Girls!” It was Mrs. Balfour.\n\n“I think the Dean hates her,” I whispered to Tiffany. I reached down a hand to help her up.

She made a face. “It looks like they’re using your plan.”\n\n“Not my plan,” Cody objected, appalled at the notion.\n\n“Get dressed, get moving,” Gail said, reaching a hand out to help him up. She was way smaller than Cody. He shook his head at her and stood on his own. She made a face. “Look, you smell. You need to wash off, change clothes, and eat before you put on that smelly helmet of yours again.”\n\n“Smelly?”\n\nGail wrinkled her nose. “Well, it was! I cleaned it,” she admitted. “Again.”\n\n“Thanks,” Cody said, moving past her to the restroom. Five minutes later he was out, dressed, presentable, and hungry.\n\nGail intercepted him with a tray. “This is cold,” she apologized. It was a set of protein bars. Cody smiled at her, pocketed one and opened the other.\n\n“What about you?” Cody asked. He waved toward stretched out chairs. “Shouldn’t you get some rest?”\n\nGail scoffed. “Now? Do you think anyone can rest now?”\n\n“Rest, yes,” Cody said. “Sleep, no.” He pointed to the nearest bed. “You stay here.

A glimmer of blue splashed over the island and lapped at the base of the pedestal.\n\n“That’s one hundred feet,” the disembodied voice of LaReyna Angel called out.\n\n“Well, if that’s all, the lady is going to be safe,” Carrington said. “Should we move on? I mean, it’s symbolic and all but —”\n\nHe broke off as another wave crested and flowed over the Statue of Liberty, burying all but the torch.\n\n“That’s three hundred feet,” LaReyna said. Another section nearby formed a ghostly image colored for stress. “Odds of surviving are sixty-two point three percent.”\n\n“The pedestal helps,” Deke said with a nod.\n\n“Got to worry about the after effects, too,” a gruff male voice warned.\n\n“First things first,” LaReyna replied. “Now, four hundred feet.”\n\nThis time even the torch was invisible under the crash of the wave.\n\n“How many of those are we going to get?” Deke Carrington asked.\n\n“If the model is correct, we can expect about one hundred per hour,” LaReyna replied.\n\n“Well, then, she’s a goner,” Deke said, as the stress map showed multiple fracture points.\n\n“Yes,” LaReyna agreed, as the model continued, showing the torch and the head crumbling, the rest of the statue disintegrating and, with the next wave, only the pedestal remained. “I think the pedestal — no, it will start crumbling in the next twenty-four hours. There might be some remains but it depends upon the winds and the waves.”\n\n“Okay, so it’s a goner,” Deke said. “Next?”\n\n“We need to start in the north,” LaReyna replied. “The hurricane turns counter-clockwise, so the wave build-up starts there.”\n\n“But the water levels will rise just because of the rainfall,” Deke noted.\n\n“What about Long Island?” The gruff man asked. He spotted Julie, moved to her with a strange gait and held out his hand. “Dr. Dan Egan.”\n\n“Dr. Julie Fuchs,” Julie replied, taking his hand. And then, “You’re with DynaCorps?”\n\nLaReyna laughed. “He is DynaCorps.”\n\n“So… how solid is the estimate on these wave heights?” Carrington said. “I mean, if we could be assured that they’ll be lower...”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["epub", "paraphrase", "v1"]}

He glanced at his own display quickly, as his training conditioned him, and swore in alarm. Georgia’s monitor was flashing red. He reached for the red panic button but even before his fingers hit it, the room was filled with a wailing siren and the lights flashed red. Someone else had beaten him to it.\n\n“The Hangseng is crashing!” Van Doren, at one of the Asian desks, shouted. “Down one, two, three, no! five thousand!”\n\n“Something’s happening in Rome!” Norman shouted even as he rose from his desk to peer at the large room around him. He glanced at the Rome clock, it read: 03:09 the next day.\n\n“Cut the links!” Mark Nichols, the night supervisor, yelled to Van Doren. “Asia, cut all links.”\n\n“I’m cutting Europe,” Norman shouted, pulling up the program that Georgia had written for just such an emergency and executing it—knowing full well that it would take out all of Europe’s network traffic.\n\n“Asia’s cut!”\n\n“Australia’s down! New Zealand, too!”\n\n“Hong Kong is off line!”\n\n“Okay people,” Nichols called, “everyone take a deep breath, check your status and tell me what happened.” Harry turned toward him and saw that he had already pulled out his cell phone, doubtless to call Chief Bennett first and the President second.\n\nHarry pulled out his own cell phone and dialed a number he wasn’t supposed to have. It was answered immediately. He smiled to himself—he should have guessed. “Red One.”\n\n“Yeah,” Georgia MacDonald replied with the sounds of someone rushing to get dressed, “I know.”\n\n“Okay, everyone, listen up!” Nichols called. “Chief Bennett’s on his way in. I want you to call your reliefs in immediately, this is a Red One emergency.” A moment later, Nichols added, “And someone start a new pot of coffee. This is going to be a long night.”\n\n“Christ, I have to wake Jonesy,” Alan Manning swore to Harry as he pulled out his phone. Harry gave him a sympathetic look before sitting back down at his station, trying to make sense of all the data in front of him.\n\n#"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["epub", "paraphrase", "v1"]}

Then, “Whee!”\n\nCody grinned and smiled at Ellaz who nodded back, muttering, Amateurs.\n\nCody ignored her as they pulled more and more warp around them until they were finally registering Warp Nine.\n\n“Five days,” Cody reported.\n\n“Roger, five days,” Nora said. Then, “I don’t know about you, but I need to pee.”\n\nMe too, Ellaz thought. Can you manage for a few minutes without me?\n\nI’ve got the monitor running, Cody said in agreement. He felt Ellaz pull out of the comp-link and concentrated more on the “space” ahead of them, looking for any of the darker clumps that indicated a dangerous mass. The way was clear.\n\nThey were taking the standard Warp Five route out of Meath, only they were going much faster, of course. Warp Five was a mere 214 times the speed of light, they were traveling more than seven times faster than that. Fifteen hundred and sixteen times the speed of light.\n\nCody looked at the ring readings on his displays. All were green. Fuel consumption was… huh! A bit lower than imagined. He verified that they really were at Warp Nine but… yes, they were. So maybe the ring was more efficient than they’d guessed.\n\nHe pulled up a schematic of the warp bubble around them and grunted in approval when he saw that the end of the forward spindle was a good fifteen hundred kilometers in front of them. The rear was only a thousand kilometers behind them. And little Hope, not more than two hundred meters in length, was cocooned inside.\n\nHe felt Ellaz appear beside him. She grabbed his hand quickly and he squeezed back. It had become their secret handshake, here in the mind-link.\n\nA-OK, Cody reported.\n\nGood, Ellaz replied. I figured you could manage without me for a minute or two.\n\nWe’re going to have to sleep sometime, Cody reminded her.\n\nYou wish!

He waved it away, pulling up the trajectory list and frowning. He shot her a copy silently and she started looking, hissing as she read the numbers.\n\n“Largest first,” Cody said as he heard a group of people stomp aboard, pushing a supply trolley. He turned to wave at them and grinned, “Hey guys! Glad to have your help! Just top us off with anything you think we need but please hurry!”\n\n“Yes, sir, we’ll be quick!” One of them answered. A couple of minutes later, they clambered off and Cody heard them securing the airlock.\n\n“Detaching,” Bamber called. “You’re good to go, we’re raising you now.”\n\n“Roger, ready to go,” Cody called back.\n\n“And Captain… best of luck, sir.”\n\n“Captain?” Ellaz murmured softly as the shuttle was bathed once more in the light of the distant sun and they were raised back up to the surface.\n\nCody grinned. “They… um… might think that they’re dealing with Daniel Ford, my father.”\n\n“I thought he was dead.”\n\n“Well, there was some confusion,” Cody said. “He might have been just undergoing regen.”\n\n“‘Regen?’” Ellaz repeated, an eyebrow raised in disbelief.\n\n“Well, they had no trouble dealing with Captain Ford,” Cody said. “I’m not so —”\n\n“Wasp, you are cleared for departure,” the controller told them.\n\n“Roger, initiating automated departure sequence one, shaping course for —” He shot a look toward the girl.\n\n“Target Three,” Ellaz murmured to him.\n\n“Target Three,” Cody finished.\n\n“Godspeed,” Clive Bammber told them.\n\nCody turned to Ellaz. “How many gees are you good for?”\n\n“Gees?” Ellaz said. She shrugged. “Three?”\n\n“Life or death,” Cody reminded her.\n\n“Maybe five,” Ellaz said. “But not for long.”\n\n“Wuss,” Cody said, firing up the main engines and putting them to full power. Seven gees for twenty minutes. He eased back only when his relays from Ellaz’s co-pilot seat showed her approaching extreme distress. He pulled them back to two gees and turned to her. “You okay?”\n\nShe glared at him.

Markets are down by most indicators although I understand that one company, HotShots Inc, is feeling the heat.”\n\n“Yes, Julie, trading was halted earlier today as HotShots lost over twenty percent of its value,” Frank Howard said grimly. “The up-and-coming Seattle super corps has suffered a number of downgrades from speculators and some fear that the company itself is entering a terminal tailspin.”\n\n“Efforts to contact the CEO, Miz Lilu, have been unsuccessful,” Julie said. “We were able to talk with their chief finance officer, Sergei Marcks who assured us that this was merely a temporary upset in the market and nothing of concern.”\n\n#\n\nDynaCorps\n\nEl Segundo, CA\n\nSeptember 25, 12:11 Pacific\n\n“Would you look at that sucker!” Dan Egan exclaimed as he watched the track for hurricane Isaac on the big screen in his control room.\n\n“Dr. Egan,” Andrea said from his side, trying to get his attention.\n\nEgan ignored her, shaking his head at the image on the screen. He turned to Mackey. “How fast is it moving again?”\n\n“The eye or the winds?” Mackey asked.\n\n“The hurricane itself is moving northeast at fifteen miles per hour,” Andrea said, raising her voice. “The sustained winds are currently clocked at one hundred and forty-five miles an hour but are forecast to enter into Category Six winds — in excess of one hundred and seventy miles per hour in the next four hours.”\n\nEgan grunted.\n\n“Sir,” Andrea began. “Sir! Dan!”\n\nEgan turned to her.\n\n“Sir, there’s a bigger issue,” Andrea said.\n\n“Bigger than this?” Egan said. “What?”\n\n“Liability, sir,” Andrea said. Egan turned to her in amazement. “When this all settles, someone will report on those masers in the ocean.”\n\n“So? And?”\n\n“And there is a legal case to be made that those masers were operated by —”\n\n“HotShots Inc,” Egan said, waving her off. “Which is why the markets are spooked.”\n\n“Yes, but that’s not the real issue,” Andrea persisted.\n\n“Tens of millions of people are being displaced, what is the real issue?”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["epub", "paraphrase", "v1"]}

It was still dark, hours before dawn.\n\n“Good morning, this is Joe Spiegel for K*LA,” the reporter said as he looked into the camera. “I’m here outside of the DynaCorps building: The home of the new Fleet Streets project we’ve been hearing about for the past year. Today, at five am—just over two hours from now—Fleet Streets will go live and traffic jams will be a thing of the past.” He paused, smiling into the camera. “Or so we hope.”\n\n#\n\n“… so we hope.” The voice of the reporter on the nearby monitor was lost in the chaos of voices of programmers spread out across the Fleet Streets control center.\n\nOne wall of the room was a huge display built of several very large monitors. In the middle, at the bottom, was a large countdown digital display which read: -000:01:59:49.30.\n\nSpread across the room were workstations, desks with computers, keyboards and stacked displays.\n\nOn a raised platform opposite the display wall were three strategically placed workstations—John Mackey’s was smack in the center, right where the Fleet Streets Project Manager wanted it. The newsfeed came through the monitor on his left. Just below it, on the same monitor, was a repeat display of the large timer which now read: -000:01:59:48.90.\n\nLess than two hours.\n\n“Harris?” Mackey growled without looking up.\n\n“Sir?”\n\n“Where’s Ryan?”\n\n“Sir?” Alexander “Sandy” Harris repeated, glancing toward Jim Ryan’s workstation in confusion. The desk was empty. He narrowed his eyes as he glanced back to John Mackey’s desk—the chief hadn’t even looked up, how had he known? Sandy Harris considered himself to be good at keeping his eye on things.\n\n“Find him.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["epub", "qa", "v1"]}

They never see a dragon.”\n\n“Not since the Binding,” Hermes added.\n\n“That’s not broken?” I asked, looking at the tree and gaping when I realized that it was whole, undamaged.\n\n“Let’s say, that we wish to renegotiate,” Zeus said. “In the meantime, youngster, I wish to stretch my wings. It’s been thousands of years.” He flicked one wingtip. “Coming?”\n\n* * *\n\nLightning flashed and thunder roared. Zeus roared with them, swooping, twirling and diving. He even did a loop and flew upside down. Why didn’t I fall off? Well, I had a broom. And… magic.\n\nIt was the most amazing thing I’d even imagined. And, then, it got better!\n\n“Holly!” Tiffany cried, leaning forward and crouched on her broom. She was riding Hermes. Natasha was on Hera, screaming with delight. Brian was riding a bronze dragon that I didn’t know. Mrs. Balfour — no, Anna — was on a sky blue dragon. And Dad? He was on a copper dragon. Although his ride wasn’t perfect — we could only find him a mop to ride. I guess from the way he was smiling, he didn’t mind that much.\n\nIt was magnificent.\n\nWhen we finally came back down to the ground and dismounted, we found ourselves surrounded by a cluster of dragons. Twenty, thirty maybe more.\n\nI looked at them all. And then I looked at Hermes. And Tiffany. I waved to Zeus and walked over to them. Hermes turned back into a white cat.\n\nI saw the way Tiffany tensed when I looked at the cat. And I saw the way Hermes ducked his head away from me.\n\n“You’re not my familiar, are you?” I said to him.\n\n“Holly!” Tiffany cried, her hands going to her face. “I — I mean —”\n\nHermes nodded.\n\n“You belong with her,” I said, reaching down to scratch behind his ears. “So you can get lost in her bed.”\n\n“Yes,” Hermes agreed. “You and I are no longer bonded.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["epub", "summary", "v1"]}

They’ll be old hags soon enough. Powerless.”\n\n“Perhaps,” Claire said. “But what if you’re wrong?”\n\n“What?” Alistair said. “What are you suggesting?”\n\n“They could have found an amulet or something powerful,” Heinz said thoughtfully. “That might cause trouble.”\n\n“We’ve amulets of our own,” Alistair said. “And we’re trained how to use them.”\n\n“So we should strike now, while we can,” Claire said. “While they’re too young, too untrained, too foolish.”\n\n“First, we have to find them,” Alistair said.\n\n“Yes,” Claire said. “Are we agreed?”\n\nThe two men were silent for a long moment. Then, Alistair sighed. “Yes.”\n\n***\n\nI was already awake when the lights in my room snapped on. I turned to see Mom and Dad standing in the doorway.\n\n“I heard,” I told them, sitting up and grabbing my phone. I had nine text messages. I held the phone up to my parents. “What should we do?”\n\n“Tell everyone to get some sleep and we’ll talk in the morning,” Mom suggested.\n\nI nodded and tapped the message to the group. Then I lay back in bed. “Well, at least we got their attention.”\n\n“And they think we’re somewhere in America,” Dad added.\n\n“So they won’t be looking on their own front door,” I said.\n\n“Right,” Dad said, moving to turn off the lights. “Good night, sweetie.”\n\n***\n\nWe had Religion first thing so, of course, after Dad called roll we rushed up to our room and, after the bell rang, made our way to the library and down to the Caverns. Zeus was starting a campaign to call them ‘The Dragon’s Lair’ and I could tell that it was catching on with some of the group. I figured we’d call it the ‘D-L’ when we were in company.\n\nWe met Principal Belle in the Great Hall where she had a trolley laid out with bagels and hot chocolate — a mix of real and faerie food.

He had been expecting something like this all day, particularly after the guys at HR had sent the call from Harris’ mother to him. It had been an awkward conversation: Carl had tried to be nice about Harris. He remembered going bright red with embarrassment as Mrs. Harris gingerly tried to figure out if he and Harris had been romantically linked, hastily explaining that he only knew Harris from work and then only for this one task.\n\nThere was an Asian man—another bulky-looking security sort—outside the prosthetics lab. He nodded as Rogers’ German approached.\n\n“He’s inside,” the Asian told him.\n\n“Jesus is with him?” the German said.\n\nThe Asian man nodded and then looked at Rogers. “He said for me to bring him in.”\n\n“Mr. Rogers,” the German bodyguard said, gesturing to the Asian, “this is Yushi. Go with him.” To Yushi he added, “I’ll stay here.”\n\nYushi gestured for Carl to key open the lab door. The first thing he noticed was a Hispanic bodyguard eyeing him intently as he moved into the room.\n\n“Are you Rogers?”\n\n“Yes,” Carl said. The other man in the room turned his head toward him then turned his attention back to a table. The man—the famous Dan Egan himself—gestured at something that Rogers couldn’t see. “Is this all of it?”\n\n“Sir?”\n\n“It doesn’t look much,” Dan Egan said as he moved aside to make room for Rogers at the lab bench. “When I first saw it, it was bigger.” He gave Rogers a challenging look. “So how do you know this is all of it?”\n\nRogers pulled the tracker from his lab coat only to find his wrist clenched in a tight grip by the guard. “It’s the tracker,” Rogers told the guard, turning his hand over.\n\n“Tracker?” Egan asked, making a gesture with his fingers for Rogers to hand it over."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["epub", "paraphrase", "v1"]}

The scowl on his face was at odds with his words. His next words made his doubts clear. “Ça marche?”\n\n“Oui, monsieur generale, ça marche,” I replied moving forward. “Ça marche trés bien.” It works very well!\n\n“It won the race,” Lieutenant Anderson added from his station two horses back.

She forced herself up to her feet, glancing around at her charges and muttering, “I’m never having babies!” As if in answer, a baby started crying.\n\n#\n\nEllaz beat her time, arriving twenty-eight minutes later with three small cleaning bots.\n\n“Let’s see how they do,” she said, pursing her lips tightly. “I mean —”\n\n“If they don’t work, don’t worry,” Cody told her with a broad grin. “You can stay with Nora while I get it sorted out.”\n\nEllaz glowered at him then motioned to one of the bots. “I’m going to start with this one, he can smell.”\n\n“‘He?’”\n\n“Whatever,” Ellaz said. “As far as I’m concerned anything that can do this should be a ‘he.’”\n\n‘He’ — the robot “Sammy” — actually could do it. In fact, he had diapered three babies in the time it took Cody to do one. And, from the looks of the babies, ‘he’ had done a better job.\n\n“And feeding?” Cody said. “And supplies?”\n\n“They’re linked into the main computer,” Ellaz said. “They keep inventory of stock on hand and they can order more.” She jerked her thumb as a fourth robot came bustling in with two boxes of diapers on its arms. Ellaz patted the bot as it moved past, “That’s Stan.”\n\n“Sammy? Stan?” Cody said with a raised eyebrow.\n\n“Simon, Seth,” Ellaz said, pointing to the other two. “Is that a problem?”\n\n“Why ‘S?’” Nora asked.\n\n“I dunno, it rhymes with stupid,” Ellaz said, glaring at Cody. “You know, boys.”\n\n“Thanks,” Cody said."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["epub", "summary", "v1"]}

If they weren’t safe, Nat would use the word brilliant.\n\nSafe travels! I texted back. I was joined by about two dozen texts from everyone else. Brian, Terry, and Mr. Morton had all checked our phones and made them more secure. We used a special service for our texts, voice, and video calls. Mr. Morton said that it was the most secure system he could get for us.\n\n“It’s over three hours from Heathrow to the Baskerville Hotel,” I said. I eyed Tiffany’s plush bed warily. “Do you want to take first shift?”\n\nTiffany shook her head. “Hermes is going to do it,” she said, waving at her cat. “And then Zeus, and then Mordecai. They’ll wake us if there’s any trouble.”\n\n“Thanks,” I said to the visible cats. Mr. Creek’s Mordecai was somewhere else.

I plumped the pillow under my head and nodded to Tiffany who turned off the lights.\n\nI woke up in a sweat, the sheets all twisted around. My phone was ringing. I grabbed it. Mr. Morton. “Red.

Women die so easily — from the ague, from a beating, from childbirth, from nursing, from a fall, as well as just from all the things that can just as easily carry away a man. Mr. Pugh had come here from the continent and before he’d grown up in England — his accent alone made that clear. No one asked him about his past and he offered nothing in return.\n\n“We didn’t need it for the first boiler as that only made steam to regular pressure,” I told him. Mr. Pugh knew a bit about pressure, being well-read and also using it for some of the more difficult castings. “With this new one, we’re going to work at five times the atmosphere.”\n\n“What’s that in feet of water?” Mr. Pugh asked. It wasn’t as odd a question as it sounded — we were near enough to Leith port that we knew of sailors — half of Mr. Pugh’s trade came that way and so we understood about pressure at depth. Besides, the work of Lord Boyle from Ireland was available in the University library — Mr. Pugh had brought it to my attention a year or more before when I’d been arguing with him about pressure.\n\n“An atmosphere is thirty-two feet, so that would work out to the pressure of a column of one hundred and sixty feet of water,” I told him, the numbers working through my head quickly.\n\nMr. Pugh whistled. “And why the ten atmospheres?”\n\n“The five is what we’re aiming for,” I told him. “But I figure that if we test the boiler at ten, then we’ll have some safety.”\n\n“So this boiler is like those Magdeburg hemispheres of Herr Guericke’s only in reverse,” Mr. Pugh said thoughtfully.\n\n“Well, except that the hemispheres only had one atmosphere working on them, the boiler will have five trying to burst it,” I said.\n\n“Which is why we cast it so thick,” Mr. Pugh guessed. “But that thick, it’ll take longer to heat.”\n\n“It will but once heated, it’ll keep it well enough,” I said.\n\n“If you want to keep a horse warm on a cold day, you put on a blanket,” Mr. Pugh observed."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["epub", "continuation", "v1"]}

And we’ll make it so that you won’t remember. That will keep you — and us! — safe.”\n\n“No,” Terry said, “I don’t want to forget.”\n\n“Tell me about the danger,” Carla said.\n\n“Witches have a history,” I said.\n\n“Of evil,” Carla said in agreement. “Like in the Bible.”\n\nWe nodded. “So you have to swear only to do good,” I said. “And, sometimes that may be harder than you think.” I cut a look to Wanda who pursed her lips tightly.\n\n“That’s not the worst,” Nat said. “There are those out there who are still hunting witches.”\n\n“But not dragons?” Carla asked. “Aren’t they like… huge?”\n\n“When you can see them, yes,” I said, reaching up to scratch Zeus on the chin. Obligingly, he leaned down and into my fingers.\n\n“If we do too much magic —”\n\n“You get old,” Carla interrupted, “you told us that.” Then she frowned. “But —” she pointed to Anna and my Dad.\n\n“The dragons absorb magic,” I said. “They can release it if they wish.”\n\n“It itches,” Zeus said, lying. “And, for Holly here, we decided to give it back to her father and his apprentice.”\n\n“So, what’s the catch?” Terry asked. “People are after us, if they catch us, they’ll kill us, right?” We nodded. “But we get an invisible dragon and can ride them —” He saw us shaking our heads and frowned “— what?”\n\n“Invisible dragon,” I said.\n\n“You ride a broom,” Tiffany added.\n\n“So you don’t fall off,” Nat said with a grin. “And it’s the coolest!”\n\n“What else?” Carla said.\n\n“Well, Zeus has set a challenge,” I said.\n\n“We have to find witches for all thirty dragons or our deal is off,” Tiffany said.\n\n“And we have to get back into the Cave before midnight on Halloween,” Nat added.\n\n“Can we get our dragons now?” Terry said.\n\n“Zeus?”\n\n“Haephastus, Artio, Brixta,” Zeus called. “Hera!”\n\n“Hera?” I said to him in surprise.\n\n“She’s going to lose a bet,” Zeus told me smugly."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["epub", "qa", "v1"]}

And bumped into Terry’s chest. “Just think about it, okay?”\n\nAs we beat a hasty retreat, Wanda muttered, “Well, that could have gone better.”\n\n“I think we just lost the whole seventh grade,” I said miserably. Tiffany and Nat watched us as we came back to the table with commiserating expressions.\n\nSo, we still needed to find five witches.\n\n***\n\nOne of the problems of having your Dad as a teacher is… having your Dad as a teacher. I was crap in fencing. He frowned at me, his lips pursed, but said nothing. Instead he concentrated on the other fencers. Which, I suppose, was better than giving me trouble. But it made me feel worse, like my Dad couldn’t treat me the way he’d treat the other fencers.\n\n“He’s just concentrating on the others,” Tiffany said to me consolingly. “Everyone has a bad day.”\n\n“Ten days, it’ll get a lot worse,” I muttered. We did wind sprints, cooled off, and then did laps. We watched some of the eighth graders do saber work. Dad and Mr. Miller spent time coaching the older students.\n\nWhen we were done, I got changed and found Dad outside the gym, waiting for me.\n\n“Sorry,” I said to him, my eyes downcast.\n\n“Holly,” Dad said, reaching for my hand, “everyone gets a bad day. No worries.”\n\n“But you looked so sad!”\n\n“No,” he told me. “I was worried for you. I wanted to give you your space.” We walked up to the car park.\n\n“I’m sorry I was crap today,” I said.\n\n“I heard some seventh graders talking —”\n\n“Oh!”\n\n“Apparently, you gave Terry Moore a chance to be protective today,” Dad said, smiling down at me. “They didn’t want me to hear, sort of.”\n\n“Sort of?”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["epub", "continuation", "v1"]}

Harry Nilstrom easily made up for all the judgement and drama of her mother.\n\n“Audrey, stop guarding the castle and let our daughter in,” Harry said now, turning to his towering wife. He wagged his eyebrows at her. “She’s not going to steal your jewelry.”\n\n“Harry!” Audrey said reprovingly but she stepped aside, saying to Georgia, “How long are you here for? And why didn’t you call ahead? I’ll have to get the maids to make up your bed.”\n\n“It’s okay, momma. I can make my bed.”\n\n“Not in my house,” Audrey pronounced with an arched eyebrow.\n\n“It’s okay, Audrey, if she wants to make her bed, she can,” Harry said. He peered up at his daughter and whispered conspiratorially, “You’re probably the only one of us who knows where the linen closet is anyway.”\n\nGeorgia smiled. It was true: she’d been making her own bed since, at the age of five, she’d decided that an adopted daughter was supposed to be perfect for her parents. That “perfect daughter” phase, so difficult and demanding a role with awkward staged birthday parties with the bratty children of other stars, painful ballet, karate, and acting lessons, had lasted until that fateful day shortly after her twelfth birthday when her parents had finally admitted that her “adoption” had been a publicity stunt."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["epub", "continuation", "v1"]}

We don’t know how the ring will react! Ellaz warned him.\n\nEvery minute, every second, Cody replied. “What’s the population of Deneb?”\n\n“The system or the planet?” Nora asked. “Four billion for the system, three billion on the planet.”\n\n“Another billion plus in the spacehabs in orbit,” Jacob added.\n\n“What are their priorities?” Cody asked. “What will they go after first?”\n\n“The planet,” Ellaz said. “Although they took out Xerxes first back at Meath.”\n\n“They might do the same for Virzen,” Jacob said. “That’s the largest asteroid in their inner belt.”\n\n“We need to know where they’ll be in two hours when we come out of warp,” Cody said.\n\n“They could be long gone,” Nora said in a forlorn voice.\n\n“But what if they’re not?” Cody asked. “What was their order of assault?”\n\n“Asteroids, planet, docks, moons — and Deneb has four — then the spacehabs,” Gail said. “But —”\n\n“I know,” Cody said, raising a hand, “we can’t rely on that.” He frowned. “Which spacehabs?

He was going to say “ring material” but he realized that they only needed half as much as a regular freighter because they were only using one warp ring.\n\n“You need to help Nora,” Ellaz said when Cody came in from repairing another ailing bot. She grabbed his arm and tugged him along behind her.\n\nNora looked up from changing a squalling baby, her face distraught, her hair unkempt.\n\n“I got another volunteer,” Ellaz said, smiling to her.\n\nCody waved to Nora even as Ellaz bolted off. “What do you need?”\n\n“Everything!” Nora cried. She pointed to the half-diapered baby. Cody took one look and finished the job. While he did, he started thinking.\n\n“You know,” Cody began, “some of the bots might be able to —”\n\n“I’ll take anything!” Nora said, dropping into a chair and looking around wildly. “What could they do?”\n\n“Well, the right ones could diaper and feed,” Cody guessed. He thought for a moment and nodded firmly. If the bots could run wiring at micrometer levels, they could be programmed to change diapers. And clean dirty bottoms, too. Cody looked around and shouted, “Ellaz! You’ve got a job!”\n\n“Really, what?” Ellaz called back from halfway down the corridor.\n\n“I need you to program baby bots,” Cody shouted back, smiling down at the little boy who’d winced at his bellow.\n\n“Baby bots?

A trim figure stood in front of it.\n\n“Father Lawson, it’s been a long while,” Georgia MacDonald said as she stepped forward and shook his hand.\n\n“Georgia, what are you doing up at this hour?” Father Lawson said in a very paternal tone, a tone that he’d used with her many late nights back when they were both students at CalTech. “Working?”\n\n“Of course.” She reached forward and pulled him into a hug. “It’s good to see you again, Donal.”\n\n“They call me John now,” he said into her ear. “Since my ordination.”\n\n“Which do you prefer?”\n\n“Donal’s fine in private, John is preferable in company,” Father Lawson told her with a small smile.\n\n“Very well, Father,” Georgia said. She gestured to the car. “I’ll call you John in the car.”\n\nFather Lawson raised a questioning eyebrow and Georgia gave him an answering nod—their car was bugged.\n\n“The usual precautions,” Georgia said by way of explanation.\n\nInside, she passed him a lanyard with a badge hanging from it. Father Lawson donned it ceremoniously. “I’m honored.”\n\n“You should be,” Georgia said. “You wouldn’t believe how much red tape was parted to get you that.”\n\n“Probably as much as was parted on my end to get me here,” John Lawson replied.\n\n“Oh, probably.” Georgia paused as the car slowed at the gates and then moved forward again. She made a gesture toward the trunk. “You know, I was hoping that you’d have more luggage.”\n\n“You mean, access to our secure logs?”\n\n“Yeah, that and your programs.”\n\n“I have that all here,” Father Lawson said, pointing to his temple. “In one word.”\n\n“A password?” Georgia guessed. “I don’t know if they’ll be happy connecting our systems directly to yours.”\n\n“I am not particularly concerned with the NSA’s happiness,” John Lawson told her coolly."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["epub", "paraphrase", "v1"]}

Technically, he was only in charge of the grav array but no one was going to argue with a retired captain with more seniority than they had years.

Meara was just about as large in the bosom as I was which was nothing much at all. I didn’t mind; large breasts would have interfered with my work.\n\n“You’d go as a boy?” Bessie squeaked. She turned to me. “And you’d help her?”\n\n“I’ve got nothing better to do,” I said, smiling at Meara. To Bessie, I said, “Get the sewing kit and meet us in the dining room, bring the white and the black cloth.”\n\nWe’d kept bolts of both so that we could make rough clothes easily enough as forge-work always ate clothing. I was quite a hand at sewing, even if I didn’t like it nearly as much as working metal. For me, cloth was far less demanding than molten metal and so something of a relaxation.\n\n“Meara, get Mary and we’ll have a sewing party!” I said.\n\n“She’s not to come,” Meara declared.\n\n“Ach, no, but she can help with the sewing,” I said waving aside her objection. “If she doesn’t know how, there’s no better time than now to learn.”\n\nMeara was off in a flash back to the stables while I followed Bessie into the house.\n\nWe worked until it was dark and then Bessie made us a quick, simple meal of bread and butter but by then we’d two well-made if rough sets of clothing that fit Meara quite well. We’d also made Mary a new set of house clothes, long black skirt and white apron.\n\n“Now all we need are shoes for you and boots for Meara,” I declared.\n\n“I could go barefooted,” Meara offered.\n\n“Not on a Walker,” I told her, shaking my head firmly. “Too many hot things that could burn.”\n\n“Mapes is going with Mr. Cattan, isn’t he?” Mary asked.

Thirty percent more efficient than a dual ring.”\n\n“They’re not proper ships,” Admiral Cartwright sneered.\n\n“No sir, they’re not,” Cody agreed. “But we thought that we couldn’t wait years to build new ones when the aliens are due here in another ten days.”\n\n“Adam, you need to listen to the boy,” President Hanlan said fervently. He glanced around to the others at the now full conference table. “All of you.”\n\nAdmiral Cartwright considered that and, leaning forward, beckoned to Cody.\n\nCody ran them through the plan, complete with the latest additions.\n\n“A tachyon warning system?” Someone muttered when they got to it.\n\n“Available for license,” Nora replied quickly.\n\n“I’ll take you up on that, Miss,” President Hanlan said.\n\n“You want to make bombs out of AMCs?” Admiral Cartwright interjected when Cody to that part of the plan.\n\n“More like mines, actually, Admiral,” Cody replied. “We’re hoping to confuse them.”\n\n“And you want to sneak up on them, in warp, to attack from the rear?” A woman in the same uniform as the admiral asked.

I nodded toward the door. “Um, privacy, please?”\n\n“You’ve got time for a quick shower,” Mom said. “But be quick.”\n\n“Just don’t rush,” Dad added, getting a stern look from Mom.\n\n“I won’t,” I said.\n\nAnd I didn’t. I took a quick, warm shower just to get the feeling of ‘sick’ off of me. I pulled on the skort — you know, the dress/shorts — and my school top.

He glanced toward the steam engine and the boiler. “How well will they handle a tossing?”\n\nWe’d discussed this when we’d first designed the naval version of my steam engines. On a ship it was quite possible that it would rock and roll in excess of thirty degrees from side to side, up and down, so we designed the fire box to be fully enclosed and sealable with air only entering through the bottom at the grate. I was pretty sure that would hold, although I wasn’t sure how the boiler would handle being sloshed about. The engine itself was probably in no danger but the same couldn’t be said for the pair of paddle wheels which descended amidships into the sea. Nor, come to think of it, had we considered what might happen if one of the paddles were completely immersed in water — they depended upon being partly out of water at the top to work.\n\n“Maybe we should have put the engine in the mid-deck,” I said after a long moment. It had been my original suggestion but all three sailors had rejected it, fearing the increased risk of fire and also citing the extra work required to set in the paddle wheels. Now, though, the danger that the boiler or the engine might be swamped made my original suggestion to place it under cover far more cogent.\n\n“We could stop the wheels and pull them up,” Captain MacArdle said thoughtfully, peering forward as if imagining the work.\n\n“That would be difficult.”\n\n“And more of a problem if something broke,” he agreed.\n\nI nodded to show that I’d heard. After another moment I said, “I think it might be best to keep the engines running.”\n\nCaptain MacArdle made a face but nodded. He glanced up to the masts. “I’ll have some sail ready in case we need it.”\n\nJust then, the lookout cried, “Sail, ho!

Well, I will be when we get more money. I don’t know what I was thinking when I was little ‘cuz the walls are all pink hearts, rainbows, and unicorns. You see, I was really into happy endings when I was little. But, if you ignore the wallpaper, the room’s all right.

Instead, to my surprise, I found myself dreaming about the tree at school.\n\nIt was dark, misty, almost like a fog had settled around the campus. I felt drawn toward the tree, like it was calling me or something. And I walked up to it, to my side and saw that there was this huge hole in its side, like a doorway. There was a faint orange glow coming from deep down and I stepped forward only someone stepped in front of me, crying, “The dragons must not fly!”\n\nI woke up in a sweat, my heart racing. I listened for the noises of the house, found them, and let out a deep sigh in relief.

Cody knew that. He knew about radiation levels and — he didn’t need the numbers to know that the energy converter had delivered a lethal dose of gamma rays in that one moment when it converted the alien’s blaster fire.\n\nNora glanced down at her wristcomm. “We’ve got twenty-nine hours left. Cody, can you make it? Should we drop out of warp?”\n\n“No!” Cody said, raising a hand defensively. “We’ve got this.”\n\n“‘We?’” Nora repeated. “Cody, she’s gone. It’s only you and —”\n\n“The monitor,” Cody interrupted. “We —” his voice broke “— Ellaz and I tweaked it. We can manage.” He turned abruptly away from her and headed back to the flight deck.\n\nHe pulled his helmet on and stared at the warp space in front of them. Twenty-nine hours.\n\nA moment later, a hand slid into his and gripped it. Cody, in shock turned, his eyes wide —\n\nI am only a ghost, the image of Ellaz told him. My memories will fade after a while and then I’ll just… not be. But I calculate that I will retain cognition for the next forty hours, if we’re lucky.\n\nSo you’re Ellaz’s Ghost? Cody thought back, squeezing the hand in his. Do I call you —\n\nGhost is sufficient, the simulation agreed. Now, I believe I was about to whoop your ass in 3D chess.\n\nAn hour later, Cody beat Ghost in 3D chess. Is that because you’re only a copy?\n\nNo way! Ghost replied. I can’t believe that you beat me! I demand a rematch!\n\nBefore Cody could agree there was a motion that distracted him. He turned and saw the dim outline of Gail in the simulation. She was using the VR headset.\n\nI know it’s not the same, but do you need help? Gail said. And Nora says that you need to eat and sleep, too.\n\nCody stared at her for a moment, looked away and was surprised to see that he couldn’t see Ghost. Then he looked back to Gail who was eyeing him nervously.\n\nLet’s get you checked out, he told her with a grin. And then I’ll teach you 3D chess.\n\nI already know it, Gail replied. Pawn to Queen’s Level Two.\n\n#"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["epub", "continuation", "v1"]}

Then I pointed toward the archway that led out to the street. “You’d best be going, if you want to get to those errands.”\n\nSamuel nodded and strode off. In the archway, he turned back and waved.\n\n“Danni, don’t you know he’d rather be staying?” Jamie asked me teasingly.\n\n“Get back to work,” I growled. “You’ve got plenty of it, slacking off the way you’ve been.”\n\nJamie shot me a knowing look but went back to the forge. “Have you got those test plugs for me?”\n\n“Don’t tell me you’re ready to test the boiler?” I cried in surprise. Sure, I’d been the one to shape the boiler halves and set the piping but I’d left it to Jamie to finish rigging the boiler in its frame, build the gasket and bolt the two halves together.\n\n“Almost.”\n\n“Well, when you’re ready you let me know,” I warned him sternly. “In the meantime, I’ve enough work of me own.”\n\n“Master Pugh will be looking for you,” Jamie said by way of agreement. I nodded and rushed out under the archway, following Samuel’s footsteps.\n\nBut where Samuel continued through the Grass Market and on to the Cow Market and hence down to Leith port, I stopped at the first shop in the Grass Market.\n\nBells rang when I entered and old Mr. Pugh came bustling out, glasses resting on his brow. “Oh, it’s you!”\n\n“Sorry I’m late, Mr. Pugh,” I told him breathlessly. I looked around the shop and sniffed. The smell of hot metal came from the workshop in the back. “Are we ready to pour?”\n\n“Lead’s all ready,” Mr. Pugh said, turning to lead the way back. “But I’m surprised you’re all so charged up.”\n\nI gave him an inquiring look.\n\n“Didn’t I just see your fine young Samuel trot on by, looking late for an appointment?” Mr. Pugh asked me with an impish smile. The old man didn’t miss much.\n\n“He’s not mine,” I corrected. “But, yes, Samuel Cattan was chatting with us on his way through.”\n\n“Bit out of the way,” Mr. Pugh observed tartly. “Enough that he was on the trot for his real errand.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["epub", "continuation", "v1"]}

No girl was going to beat him. He was Johnny Jones, New York through and through and no damned SoCal bitch was going to steal his show.\n\n“No thank you,” Jones said. “I think, as you’ve seen, we’re going to get this done, on time and under budget.”\n\n“Hmm,” Mackey grunted. “Well, John, no one wants it more than you, that’s for sure. And, Mr. Egan has given you his full support.” He paused. “Let’s touch base in two weeks.”\n\n“Very well,” Jones said. He ended the call. With a sigh, he pushed himself out of his chair and charged out the door. He continued until he was out of the building. There, he stretched and then began a light jog.\n\nJogging always helped his thinking. At least, since he’d got back to New York. He went to the northwest end of Central Park, intending to circle back there and return for a quick shower before his next class. He was just making the turn when a small boy darted at him. Jonesy hopped to one side but the boy blocked him so quickly that Jonesy tripped over him. He rolled with it but still ended up stretched out on the hard concrete. He took a moment to pull himself together. Stupid kid!\n\nHe got up, looked around, worried that he’d sent the kid sprawling despite his best intentions but there was no one there. Worried, Jonesy looked around, trying to spot any mothers looking for lost children. He even walked — well, not quite limped — into the park to see if the kid had gone there. Finally, he turned back to the college. He forced himself into a trot even though several of his muscles protested and promised aches later."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["epub", "qa", "v1"]}

Cody wasn’t too surprised that this copy of Ellaz had aligned herself with Lucy. Lucy was, aside from this latest design, a smart person who had a level head — most of the time — on her shoulder. “Six rings for safety. Max speed Warp Five.”\n\n“Maybe Warp Seven,” Lucy added in a smaller voice. She saw Cody wince and added defensively, “The math works.”\n\n“And how many of these sausages do you plan on building?”\n\n“They can carry five arcs each,” Nora said, pointing to the specs, “and we’re going to need —” she frowned as she pulled up the number “— twelve hundred and fifty-seven of them which means two hundred and fifty-two trips.”\n\n“If we decide we have to transport them,” Ellaz King observed.\n\n“How else —” Cody began only to break off. “You want to send the ring by itself?”\n\n“It’s a possibility,” Ellaz said. “I mean, it’s gotta work right? Else why build it? So why not send it from here to Deneb?”\n\n“So why this sausage thingy if you’re not going to transport the arcs to Deneb?” Cody demanded.\n\n“Well,” Ellaz said with a bit of a giggle, “it was fun to build.”\n\n“And we’ll need it for the test,” Lucy added.\n\n“Test?”\n\n“We have to know that it’ll work,” Nora told him reasonably. “The test of the ring segments, right? What sort of test?”\n\n“Well, we don’t want to use too many rings,” Ellaz said, “so we figured we could make do with a twelve kilometer circumference.\n\n“We’ll test incrementally, starting at Warp Four,” Lucy said. “We’ve got the math all the way up to Warp Seven, we’d like to test that far.”\n\n“Warp Seven?” Cody repeated. “Twelve kilometers? Two rings? And what cargo?”\n\n“Ah!” Lucy said, grinning. “That’s the thing!

She was surprised that the trip had taken less than an hour; usually it took closer to three hours than two. Clearly, this Fleet Streets thing was doing some good.\n\nNot, she thought ruefully, that it would do her much good without a car. The fare had been over a hundred dollars. She could manage that precisely three more times, even with the coverage of her insurance.\n\nThe first news of the day had been dismal—her insurance agent phoned to confirm that because the car was a few years old, she’d get a little more than three thousand for it—far less than the twenty-seven thousand it would cost to replace it. And she couldn’t afford a new car, not now.\n\n“Hey, Sue, your ride’s here,” Al Mercer called into the office. “You didn’t tell me you were going for a Mercedes!”\n\n“A Mercedes?

His expression grew more sour as he continued, “As we have now in our possession a modest force of cannon, His Highness wants to know if you could construct Walkers sturdy enough to convey them with our army.” He paused for a moment then added, “Needless to say you would find yourself handsomely rewarded and His Highness is willing to confer upon you the title of Royal Artificer of Walkers with a monopoly.”\n\n“That’s very gracious of His Highness,” my father said slowly, bowing to the Prince who smiled and nodded back. Father moved to speak into the General’s ear and I, used to his ways, sidled up beside him. “Does such a title not depend upon his father regaining the throne?”\n\n“Of course,” General Murray replied stiffly. He twisted his head toward our one Walker and asked, “Are you saying you’ve no faith in your own invention?”\n\nThe general’s comment galled me. It was my invention and everyone knew it.\n\n“It’s not the invention alone that will be put to the test,” father replied. He frowned as his gaze lighted upon our three sailors. “And I’ve obligations already which I cannot honorably neglect.”\n\nGeneral Murray in his turn frowned at the sailors. “If I may be permitted to ask, what obligations have you made?”\n\n“We’re building a steam ship,” I spoke up from father’s side. I gestured toward the completed engine. “In fact, we’re just about to start trials.”\n\n“How soon, sir, would it be before the engine is installed in a ship?” Lieutenant Anderson asked with a respectful nod toward the general. He saw the general’s frown deepen and added, “I was thinking that a ship that worked against the wind would be as unstoppable on the sea as the Walkers on land.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["epub", "continuation", "v1"]}

His expression darkened as he added, “And she made it quite clear that she would take action if we didn’t listen.”\n\n“The stock exchanges?” Georgia asked. She didn’t wait for Father Lawson’s answering nod before continuing, “So she has a moral system, a sense of what’s right and wrong, but we don’t know if mankind is included in it.”\n\n“Or whether we’re considered good or bad,” Lawson added in agreement.\n\nGeorgia blew out a breath, shaking her head in exasperation. “If I had to guess, I’d say that Jim did it, but—”\n\n“But?”\n\nGeorgia bit her lip before continuing, “But if he did, why isn’t he shouting from the highest rooftops, taking it to the airwaves, telling the whole world?”\n\n“For that matter, if it wasn’t him, why hasn’t someone come forward, even if it was China or Russia?”\n\n“Yeah,” Georgia agreed. “Whoever gets the first AI, wins.”\n\nThey were silent, lost in thought for another long while.

Then he looked up at Georgia. “Why don’t we pay a visit to him?”\n\n“Who?” Georgia asked struggling to return from her distracted thoughts. “Jim?”\n\n“Yes,” Father Lawson said. “At the very least, we could knock our current pet theory on its head.” He grinned at her. “Besides, I’m hungry, and I believe his new company is not all that far down the road from here.”\n\n“You know,” Georgia said, “I think that’s a very good idea!”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["epub", "qa", "v1"]}

Dad gave her a look but said nothing — we were all a bit on edge. She waved to me and Anna. “Mom wants to know if you can stay at my place tonight.”\n\nDad, naturally, heard it all. After a moment, he nodded. Anna nodded too.\n\nI suppose no one will be surprised when I say that none of us were fencing at our best.\n\n“Jasmine?” I said as we finished in the locker room, changing.\n\nJasmine smiled. “Oh, am I coming to Tiffany’s house tonight?” she guessed. Her grin broadened. “What do you think?”\n\nSo it was four of us who met Mr. Morton in a big black SUV. We clambered inside and went through the same journey, complete with hoods to keep us from seeing parts of the route, and down underground to the front of the ‘Creeks’ house.\n\nIf you don’t remember, Tiffany’s dad is this super-famous Hollywood star and ‘Creek’ isn’t their real name — if anyone knew who he was, she’d be swamped at school. And Tiffany’s mom, well —\n\n“Holly!” Tisha Creek cried as we piled out of the car. She tottered over and gave me a quick hug before reaching for Anna and Jasmine in turn. She looked like she was ninety or so but she was really much younger. She hadn’t been young when I first met her but with her dragon, Artemis, she got younger. Only, because she’s a spy — or whatever — she doesn’t let her new age show. Too many people knew her and too many people watched her. You see, Mrs. Creek had been a witch long before the rest of us. Her magic was air magic. In particular, she had a way with words and voice that allowed her to broker peace in the troubled parts of the world. She’d used her gifts long before she knew about dragons and so she’d spent her life force when she’d done her magic. And so, she was older than she should have been.

That had been an old question at seminary school when Lawson was studying for the priesthood.

But that was still weeks off, because he had to wait for Emma and, particularly, for Gail.\n\nNot that he had time to worry about that, given the schedule they’d built.\n\nDon Hartman was still laying the groundwork for the forthcoming vote and Dorit Williams had started working with her PR people to build support for “saving mankind.”\n\nCody had seen plans, counterplans, replans for twenty different projects. The ring sections at Carlow were building steadily.

Cody’s sixteenth birthday was still a ways off.\n\n#\n\n“Meath Approach this is Tristan, inbound with three ships,” Nora called from the bridge three and a half days later as they broke out of warp.\n\n“Tristan, what are you doing here?” Lucy King called back. “And how fast were you going?”\n\n“Warp Ten Point One,” Nora replied, smirking.\n\n“Impressive,” Lucy replied. “Well, we’re glad to see you.”\n\n“We brought supplies,” Nora offered.\n\n“You are cleared for Carlow orbit,” Lucy replied. “How soon can you get down here?”\n\n“Give us three hours,” Nora said. “Looking forward to it!”\n\n“Well, I hope to surprise you!”\n\n#\n\n“Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday dear Nora, happy birthday to you!” They all sang as Nora entered the cafeteria at Carlow Main. Cody and Nora hardly recognized it, the old central control section was almost completely rebuilt, with lights burning brightly against the vacuum darkness outside. All twenty docking tubes were functional and Nora was thrilled to see a new hydroponics section brimming with life.\n\n“Go on! Blow out the candles!” Cody said to her as she leaned over the huge cake.\n\nFortunately there were only thirteen candles and Nora had no problem dispatching them.

I mean, I could say that The Order wanted to kill us but… that we’d have to flee for our lives? That was something else entirely!\n\n“‘Be prepared,’” Dad reminded me. He turned to Mr. Seris and held up his pizza boxes. “Boris, where should we put these?”\n\nBoris smiled and waved to a table against the far wall of his ‘gym.’ We followed Mom and Dad. The pizza was good and we all ate it with relish. Julia insisted on telling everyone how good she was at Portalling and how she could do it all night.\n\n“Another two hours, only,” her Dad warned her. When she tried to protest, he gave her a look and she subsided. “You need your beauty rest so you’ll be ready tomorrow morning.” That cheered her up immediately.\n\n“Are we staying here?” Julia asked excitedly.\n\n“Of course!”\n\n***\n\nWe spent the whole weekend in the Dragon’s Lair. And we learned so much! We learned that the magic from a Portal fades out from the direction of the jump — so if you jumped, say, from Los Angeles to New York, the Portal in New York would fade out last with the ‘mark’ of the magic furthest from it fading out more quickly.\n\nBecause we couldn’t do long jumps in the cave, we weren’t certain how long the ‘marks’ lasted for long jumps. But at least we knew that the only thing that we could Detect (Anna was careful to point out that we could be wrong) was the direction. So doing a number of jumps — like in a zig-zag line — would probably put off anyone trying to track us back to our start.\n\n“Enough jumps, though, and they could start making educated guesses,” Terry said when we shared our results with him Saturday night.\n\nWe made enough progress with the Fake Portals that we could demonstrate them to Brian, Terry, and Mr. Creek.

Sort of like a zombie shadow.\n\n“My report was accurate, insightful,” Brian said. His father had probably told him so. Mr. Herald… well, he made Brian look good. Except… strangely, Mr. Herald ran a gym. He taught the people who taught movie stars. And… well, he was a sweetie. A big, sometimes very scary, teddy bear.\n\n“Yeah,” Tiff snorted, “you keep saying that, computerhead.” She rushed ahead of us.\n\nBrian looked stumped. I told him, “She’s just upset because you’re smarter than her.”\n\n“I am smarter than everyone,” Brian said. “Even you.”\n\nI patted him on the shoulder. “Of course.”\n\nBrian stopped, his brows furrowed. “Why aren’t you upset?”\n\n“Because, sweetie, you’re my friend,” I told him. I tugged at him to move on because, well, when Brian stops… he forgets to move, sometimes. I tugged again. He noticed. “Come on, we’re going to be late.”\n\nHe came. We were late anyway.\n\nFortunately, Mr. Beamer was still calling roll. He’d read past Brian’s name but hadn’t read past mine. So I could answer on time. He went back through the roll and got Brian.\n\nMr. Beamer was our Science teacher. And Mr. Beamer knew all about Brian. Brian and his volcano. Brian and his paper on earthquakes. Brian and his article on the nature of subduction zones. It took poor Mr. Beamer a full five minutes before he recalled that there were others in the class. I had a feeling that Brian and Mr. Beamer would get along fine.\n\nUnfortunately for Brian, we were going to be learning about biology this year. But Mr. Beamer mentioned that everyone was encouraged to take on different science projects… and his gaze shot to Brian so I was pretty sure that Mr. Beamer had invented that just for my friend.

She waved a hand. “Can you?”\n\n“No,” the dozen students in the lecture hall mumbled in succession.\n\n“Because we developed one AI?” Georgia asked. “Or because we’re developing more?”\n\n“Well,” Bret said, “we’ve had ‘AI’ —” and he used air quotes “— for some time, Professor.”\n\n“But not General AI,” Sophie Morton protested. Georgia nodded to her, giving her the floor. “Before we had specialized AI, something that could make a pretty picture if it was trained well enough —”\n\n“But the Vatican!” Xavier Holllister exclaimed.\n\n“Entirely different!” Bret said.\n\n“In fact, it proves my point,” Sophie said. “Before Ellay we had nothing like her capabilities. She planned for the reconstruction of Los Angeles before the earthquakes —”\n\n“‘She?’” Xavier challenged.\n\n“Shit, you don’t believe the garbage coming from the government, do you?” Bret exclaimed.\n\n“Just checking,” Xavier said, looking relieved.\n\n“She was a zillion times more powerful than anything we’ve ever seen and —”\n\n“And a bullet killed her,” Bret interjected.\n\n“Yeah, how come she didn’t see that coming?” Xavier demanded of Sophie. “I mean, if she’s so smart, how come she didn’t know?”\n\n“What if she did?” Bret said. “What if she knew and made the choice anyway?”\n\n“The first AI is a martyr?” Xavier scoffed.\n\n“You morons!” Sophie shouted over them. “The question was — has the singularity happened?”\n\n“Yes!” Bret said. “Once she showed what she could do, nothing is the same.”\n\n“But she’s gone,” Xavier said in a quieter voice. “So do things go back the way they were?”\n\n“Not when we’re building her replacement,” Sophie said with a snort.\n\n“And how long will that take?” Bret said. “I mean, we’ve got all these traffic projects going but — will they make an AI?” He turned to Georgia. “Professor?”\n\n“There is some belief that a tipping point was reached with the AI in Los Angeles,” Georgia said. “At some point analysis gave way to prediction —”\n\n“You mean a non-linear event,” Bret said. “A cascade and then… sentience.”\n\n“That’s one theory,” Georgia agreed.

Cody smiled as Nora came racing down and into his arms. She kissed him and hugged him tightly. He kissed her back, grinning at her.\n\n“Attention!” Colonel Hutchinson barked. “Welcome aboard Tristan, Admiral!” He and the other marines grinned broadly at Nora’s sudden discovery that they had an audience.\n\n“Thank you, Colonel!” Nora said, turning to kiss Cody once more.\n\n#\n\nImmediately after, Nora insisted on seeing the babies. The living ones first. She played with them all and then she and Cody turned to the six replicators, all their monitors glowing with the green of health.\n\n“They’re in the second trimester and are all doing perfectly,” Dr. Noran assured them when she found them ogling over the six replicators. She nodded to Nora. “Do you have time to update your voice?”\n\nNora nodded. It was well-known that babies required outside sounds — particularly of their mothers in order to grow and thrive. Nora was the “mother” for five of the babies — Ellaz was “mother” for Ellen Whirly. Cody was “father” for all six but he could visit them regularly, and did — usually with Ellaz providing added commentary. Nora Wasp was often available — having kept her name from the original ship.\n\nThe real Nora spent a good half hour with the replicators, singing to them, telling them the latest news and providing a good recording of her voice, heartbeat, breathing, and other signs of their “mother.”\n\nLater, in Cody’s cabin, they ate a candle-lit dinner while exchanging anecdotes on their crews’ antics over the last three days.\n\n“Twelve weeks, five days,” Nora said when they lay together, listening to soft music and watching a quiet vid together. She had her head on his shoulder so she looked up to say to him, “Can you believe it?”\n\nCody shook his head. “And what are we going to do with them all?”\n\nNora laughed. “We’ll think of something.”\n\n#\n\nThey had breakfast and Cody saw her off in her shuttle two hours later. He breathed a sigh of relief when Nora reported that she was safely back aboard her Phoenix.\n\nTwo hours after that, they broke the merged warp."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["epub", "continuation", "v1"]}

I could see how much easier it would be to steer the walker with the rigging and I was certain that it’d be faster and more limber. Why, I might even figure out how to get a trot.\n\nOur conversation widened and I mentioned my new boiler and some of the ideas that Mr. Pugh and I had tossed about. With Mary hovering nearby we were never short of tea; I apologized to the men that I was unable to offer them anything stronger — I knew enough about sailors to not be too distraught over that for even with enough beer the conversation would have grown unruly and not have been as insightful as it was.\n\nWe thought of this steam horse as a war horse and designed it with the notion that it would be attacked. We thought of adding sidewalls which we could position at an angle to make it harder for someone to climb up, we determined how to bury our cables so that they could not be severed and then — this was a combined machination — we came upon the idea of using the hot coals in the boiler as an emergency defense, dumping them atop of any would-be attackers.\n\nThat idea prompted me to recall Mr. da Vinci’s famous steam cannon and to consider how to adapt it further.\n\n“These are great ideas, gentlemen, but father has rightly pointed out that we are under contract to reproduce our proven walker and not some new experimental beast,” I said when our conversation ebbed.\n\n“Were ye not to build five more walkers?” Mr. Henry asked.\n\nI nodded.\n\n“But there are six full sets of engines and boilers out there.”\n\n“One’s a spare in case of poor pouring,” I said.\n\n“But if they’re all sound...”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["epub", "paraphrase", "v1"]}

Joe Tucker thought to himself. He knew who was going to feel the axe if he was wrong.\n\n“Thanks, Mr. Mayor,” Joe said and was surprised at the lack of bitterness in his voice.\n\n“But just in case, remind me about our readiness levels,” John Moretti continued a moment later.\n\n“Well sir, Ryan’s team has predicted that the quake will hit Sunday, February 22nd—”\n\n“Washington’s birthday,” John Moretti murmured.\n\n“—at 3:14 am,” Joe continued with a nod acknowledging the mayor’s interjection. “That will be just about in the middle of a long weekend. We can expect a lot of people to be out of town, and the rest to be safely in their beds.”\n\n“Hmph.”\n\n“Because it’s a holiday, we’ve got the normal police and fire department presence, and we on the staff feel that there’s really no need for more.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["epub", "continuation", "v1"]}

I was going to hurt a lot, later. But at the moment, I didn’t care.\n\n“Got them!” Tiffany cried joyfully. “Extract!”\n\n“Need some help here!” I cried as I pulled out a couple of Light coins and popped them off, blinding everyone who hadn’t expected them. Then I threw some Hide’N’Seeks around the room. In the smoke and haze, I grappled Anna and pulled her back to me. In a moment I Portaled.\n\n“Clear!” I shouted, before Portaling again. And again. Finally, I let go of Anna and lowered her to the ground. “We’re safe.”\n\n“I’m so glad to hear that,” Claire Fraser said, lowering her Illusion and smiling at me as she grew to her full, overpowering height. She held something in front of her. It was a scepter.\n\n“Trap!” I shouted, pulling Cali from my arm.\n\nClaire’s eyes widened in surprise but she brought her scepter forward and jerked it, throwing a spell at me.\n\nCali caught it. Yum!\n\nClair and I both stared at the foil in disbelief. And then — “En garde!” I cried, lunging forward. Claire tried another spell, Cali caught it, and I took another step forward, using Cali to block Claire’s scepter.\n\nLet me have it all, Cali begged. I’m hungry!\n\nI didn’t need to be asked twice. I stepped forward again and Claire stepped back. It was obvious that she’d never fenced before. And it was obvious that —\n\nWith a brilliant blue-white flare, Cali struck the scepter. The scepter blazed — but Cali absorbed all of its power. I could feel the blade in my hand grow in strength as it ate all of the spells that the scepter had held. And then Cali flashed forward, without my control, seeking to slash Claire’s throat wide open.\n\nNo! I cried, pulling back and lowering the flaming blade. I didn’t think, I just acted. Because, in that moment, possessed of all that power, Excalibur scared me more than anything on the planet."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["epub", "qa", "v1"]}

The bell rang shortly after but we stayed behind to ‘help him pack up’ and gave him a terse report. His features darkened as he listened to what we had to say. He shook his head then said to me, “We are not like this!”\n\n“No,” I agreed. Zeus, on my shoulder, nodded fiercely. As it was, we rushed off to our next class, just barely making it in time. It was Async, so we could get together and talk for a bit.\n\nMr. Miller was on duty and he greeted us with a grim expression — it was clear he’d heard something of what had happened. His cellphone beeped not long after we were seated and he answered it. He nodded once and went over to Anna.\n\n“Your father has asked for you and your cousin,” Mr. Miller said, nodding to Eric. He pulled out two permission slips and passed them over. “He’s in the Nurse’s Office.”\n\nI smiled at them as they left and exchanged looks with Tiffany who smiled back. It was pretty obvious that Anna and Eric were going to get a roommate. At least for a while.\n\n***\n\nAnna and Eric still weren’t back by lunchtime. Tiffany was worried, “What about tonight?”\n\nI shrugged. I had the same worry — Mr. Harte was supposed to be the first to Portal out. But… “Well, then we’d just start with Mrs. Belle.”\n\nStill, we were all glum and nervous.\n\n“I have an idea,” I said to Tiffany and Jasmine. “Why don’t we bring our foils to the Library?”\n\nJasmine caught on immediately. She grinned at me and said, “And our helmets, too.”\n\nTiffany’s eyes widened as she figured out what she meant.\n\nSo just before PE, we all grabbed our gear, ran up to the Library and into the Caverns.\n\n“Mr. Lucks —” I began.\n\n“Doctor Lucks,” Tiffany corrected me."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["epub", "qa", "v1"]}

I passed it over and retreated to the wall. I don’t think Mr. Mallory was as quick with her as he was with me. But I watched them. They were only practicing. I could see when Tiffany’s legs started to hurt from the lunges — mine were still complaining — but she didn’t slow down one bit.\n\n“He pushed you pretty hard,” a voice said from beside me. I looked over. It was Jasmine. “I wish he’d do that with me.”\n\n“I thought I was going to die,” I told her.\n\nShe smiled and shook her head. “With some practice and exercise, Holly, you’ll beat everyone in this room.” She chuckled. “Of course, you’ll want to give it a couple of years.”\n\n“You mean I could do it?” I said. “Seriously?”\n\n“You’re that good already,” she said. “People, when they fence, they go through phases. One day you’re unstoppable, the next day you can’t put one foot in front of the other. But stick to it and day by day, you’ll get better. Lots better.”\n\nThe bell rang. Mr. Mallory stood back and ended the bout with Tiffany who pulled off the fencing mask and bowed to him, like in martial arts.\n\nJasmine noticed and said to me, “Did you do martial arts, too, Holly?”\n\n“With Brian,” I told her. “His dad is an instructor, he has his own dojo.”\n\n“Brian… Herald?” Jasmine said, her eyes going wide. “You trained with Breakjaw Herald?”\n\n“Breakjaw?”\n\n“That was his fighting name,” Jasmine said. “My dad and I watched all his matches.” She shrugged. “Repeats because he retired.” She gave me a considering look. “You know that people pay thousands of dollars to train with him, right?”\n\nI shook my head. He was just Brian’s dad. A nice guy who made training fun. Kind of like Mr. Miller, come to think of it. And… well, I think Mr. Herald was kind to me because Brian had so few friends.\n\nI frowned. “Why isn’t Brian here?”\n\n“Chess club,” Jasmine said immediately. “Coach Harte is convinced that he’ll rank by the end of the year.”\n\n“Coach Harte?” I said. “Like Dean Harte?”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["epub", "continuation", "v1"]}

My father, my brother, Samuel, Meara, Mapes — all were at the far end of this city, fighting for their lives. Fighting because one foolish red-headed girl thought it would be fun to build a walking machine.\n\n“Very well, lieutenant Boadicea, you may lead,” Colonel Drummond said, moving to the side and clambering back down to the ground, his voice rising into a bellow as he called, “Sergeant Major MacGregor! Rouse the troops, prepare for battle!”\n\n“Sir!” A voice boomed back in the darkness.\n\nSteel buckets came up the side and hot coals from the campfires were placed under Lightning’s boiler. The water in the boiler was still warm — I’d taken care to ensure that, ordering blankets be placed around the bare metal, much to the sniggering of the men. Now my precaution would pay off.\n\n“All troops, man your positions!” I bellowed as I heard the first chug of steam hit the engine. In addition to my two doughty artillerymen, I’d acquired a small squad of the Colonel’s Royal Scots — mostly the ones who were suited the walker’s pace and smart enough to prefer riding to walking.\n\n“MacDonald, George, you’re on the guns!” I called, moving forward to them. Two privates moved to the Puckle guns and gazed at them in perplexity.\n\n“Sergeant Donelly, show them what to do,” I called, turning back to my pilot-stand and then back to the boiler and the toiling Private Dawson who’d insisted upon stoking the boiler himself.\n\n“Captain O’Hara, we’re ready to move out, sir,” I called as I engaged the clutch and began slowly walking Lightning forward.\n\n“Remember, lieutenant, you’re to take the gates and hold them for my troops!” Colonel Drummond called as I moved off.\n\n“Yes, milord!” I called back. In a lower voice, I told the men on Lightning, “Hold on, lads, we’re going to see how fast we can go!”\n\nWith that, I opened up the throttles full, found the road and bore down upon it."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["epub", "summary", "v1"]}

He knew I hadn’t; no one had. “So how can ye be sure all this will work?”\n\n“We’ll learn in the trying, Mr. Stoops,” I told him, pointing toward a cable. “That one goes to the near foreleg.”\n\n“The what?”\n“Port forrard beam, Stoopie, the lass means the port forrard beam,” Mr. Henry told him, glancing down at me and nodding with a wink.\n\n“And why didn’t she say so, then?”\n\n“Ach, she’s only a wee lass, Stoopie, she’s no knowledge of the sea, has she?”\n\n“Probably just as well, she’d be taming the very waves next,” Mr. Stoops said, dragging the cable to the near foreleg.\n\n“This is a walking horse, Mr. Stoops,” I said to him, “it’s best to think of it that way.” I pointed to the near foreleg and named it, then the far foreleg, the near hind leg and, finally, the far hind leg.\n\n“What a daft set o’ names!” Mr. Stoops allowed, even as he followed my instructions on the setting of the cable.\n\nMr. Gillie had worked it out a treat: we had cables to raise the calf beam and the thigh beam, cables to lower both, and cables to move the whole leg. That was easy enough, the trick was in building the gearing that moved the whole leg and all four legs in the right order. Worse, we had to gear the whole to allow us to reverse and to turn, to raise the front or the rear of the platform."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["epub", "continuation", "v1"]}

She looked over to Egan. “What is she?”\n\n“She’s the cavalry,” Egan told her.

I’m used to something more compact. And I couldn’t handle the extra insurance.”\n\n“Oh,” Mr. Orr said, catching on. “You’d prefer a more ‘economic’ car?”\n\n“Yes,” Susan said. “I would.

Certainly that had been the start of Boeing’s decline as a bleeding-edge aerospace company, allowing nimbler outfits like SpaceX to outperform the old established airplane manufacturer. Some said that Boeing went from a philosophy of “What can we do?” to “What can we get away with?”\n\n“Okay, what can we do?” Susan asked, reflecting Boeing’s earlier philosophy.\n\n“We’re a services provider,” Al said. “And without customers…” he broke off and shrugged helplessly.

It took a few minutes for the boiler to build the extra pressure but once it did we could feel the difference. The gait seemed almost to change as the beat of the legs on the ground increased and the platform lurched for moments before steadying.\n\nThe engine was puffing and blowing so fast it made a steady chuff-chuff-chuff noise above which father could be barely heard when he shouted, “Look at ‘em!”\n\nHe was pointing to the sea and I turned my head to see that we were outpacing the ship.\n\nI risked a quick glance behind and saw that the horsemen had fallen behind — all except one who had urged his horse into a full-on gallop.\n\nChuff-chuff-chuff-chuff-chuff!\n\nWoot-woot! Father pulled on the whistle and waved merrily at the approaching horseman. His horse swerved in fright at the sound and the poor rider was nearly unseated; only his skill kept him in the saddle.\n\nA few more bone-jarring minutes later, father called to me, “We’ve made our point, let’s slow down!”\n\n“Turn the valve,” I said, pointing to the valve that connected the boiler to the engine, “and then remove the six plug.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["epub", "continuation", "v1"]}

Neither was taller than I which made them rather short for men but they looked healthy, appearing to be in their late teens or early twenties. I glanced over to Mal who was receiving Mr. MacArdle and the other two seaman. He caught my look and I raised a hand to my hat. He returned the salute readily then turned his attention back to Mr. MacArdle.\n\n“Where away, lads?” I said to our newcomers. They traded glances, then one spoke, “If you continue down the road, sir, you’ll see our ships.”\n\nI got the notion that Mr. MacArdle might be trying out candidates for our crew, so I turned to Mr. Henry, saying, “Pass your shovel to one of these lads and let them have a turn, Mr. Henry.”\n\n“Aye, sir,” Mr. Henry replied, knuckling his forehead in salute. He thrust a shovel at one and showed him what to do. I turned to our remaining sailor and said, “Move to the bow and keep a look out.”\n\n“Aye, sir,” he said, moving forward slowly, not certain what to expect.\n\n“We can step over anything as high as four feet but we don’t want to get caught in a rut or slip on a patch of frost or mud,” I shouted up toward him. He turned back to me, his brows furrowed and I gestured at him in irritation, “Your eyes on the path, not on me!”\n\nWe moved slowly through the narrow streets and I had Mr. Henry tell our new stoker to slacken off somewhat as we didn’t need much more steam.\n\nWe stopped at the docks beside one ship which I saw, much to my surprise, had been named Danielle. I caught Mr. Henry’s eye and glanced toward the name and he shrugged, nodding over to Mr. Stoops as if to say it was his idea.\n\nIt turned out that the Danielle was the name given our first steamer which, until then, had been the Rosemary’s Way — the one I’d helped construct and had raced against when Jamie was at its controls. It seemed a very long time ago.\n\n“Mr. Henry, how do we propose to board?” I said, trying to sound nautical."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["epub", "qa", "v1"]}

He grinned at me as he added, “We wagered quite heavily — and well.”\n\n“I’m flattered.”\n\n“You shouldn’t be,” Lieutenant Anderson said as he passed me his sword and I examined it, checking the structure of the blade, the cut of the edge. It was well-honed but could do with an extra edge. “Your work inspired us.”\n\n“And the Prince was most impressed,” the other Cameron added, seeming upset that the others had dominated me in conversation.\n\n“Gentlemen, if you’d prefer wait inside, I’m sure Bessie could make you a cup of tea.”\n\n“I’d prefer watch the master at work,” Lieutenant Anderson said gallantly.\n\n“Unless you’d like a cup yourself?” the younger Cameron suggested, looking around the gloomy yard. “Do ye?”\n\n“Well,” I said, trying to hide my blush, “I wouldn’t say no.”\n\nAnd so the younger Cameron strode briskly across the yard to the kitchen while the other two gathered around the sharpening stone, watching intently as I spun it up faster and faster with my foot.\n\nI laid a good fine edge on Lieutenant Anderson’s sword and had started on Captain Cameron’s when the younger Cameron returned with Bessie toting a tray alongside.\n\n“Take a rest, you’ve earned it,” lieutenant Cameron said but I shook my head, “I’ve just started on this blade, it’d be wrong to stop until it’s finished.”\n\nThey all gathered around while I finished up Captain Cameron’s sword and then insisted that I take some tea, “While it’s still warm.”\n\nI was happy to do so and thanked Bessie who looked askance at the three gallant highlanders. I could tell she was having a harder time following their speech than she did mine.\n\n“You ought to say something to her in Gaelic,” I said to the younger Cameron. “She’s English born and doesn’t know a word.”\n\nWell, if it was a cold day before, you’d swear it’d had started snowing for the reaction they gave that news.\n\n“What?” I said, looking up at them.

We’ve got a preliminary list of targets. We’re passing the first set to you —” he glanced around the shuttle. “How many can you take at a time?”\n\n“If you get me the fuel and air, we can handle thirty, easily,” Cody said. “Fifty in a pinch.”\n\n“Right,” Clive said. “We’ve only got two cargo shuttles available —”\n\n“Don’t you have a full fleet?” Cody interrupted.\n\n“And we’d use it but…” Clive frowned. “I’m afraid we’re not going to need them right now.”\n\n“That bad?” Cody said, his heart sinking.\n\n“Worse,” Clive admitted. “So we’re going to turn you around now, in hopes that —”\n\n“Right,” Cody agreed. “So why did you pull us down?

He waved a hand back into his shuttle. “Do you need anything else or should I look at your download?”\n\n“Do you need anything else, sir?” Clive said.\n\n“Can you get a crew to top off our stores and add as many medpacks as you think we’ll need?” Cody said after a moment.\n\n“Sure!” Clive said, he raised his wristcomm and called out a few orders. “They’ll be here before we’re finished fueling.”\n\n“How are you guys on that?” Cody asked, meaning their supplies of fuel.\n\n“We have nominal stocks,” Clive told him with a frown. “But… for this!”\n\n“Yeah,” Cody said. “So, we’ll track down the signals, do the SAR and then we’ll probably need to talk more.”\n\n“Yes, sir,” Bamber agreed.

And then — then I was in the forest. With the gingerbread house. I was waiting inside, rubbing old, worn hands to remove the pain and listening as two high-pitched voices called excitedly to each other. Oh, soon!\n\nNo! No, it won’t work! Please! Please, don’t try it! I heard someone wail. Me? Erich?\n\nMy eyes jerked open and I turned to see Hermes. Beyond him, in my bed, Tiffany’s eyes gleamed with moonlight.\n\n“It didn’t work,” I told her. By the way her eyes shifted, I could tell she was nodding.\n\n“They pushed her into the oven,” Tiffany said, recalling the story.\n\n“They tricked her into the oven,” Hermes said.\n\n“Cat,” Tiffany said, “how do you talk?”\n\n“Very well, thank you,” Hermes replied flippantly, rising and spinning around before settling himself down again. “Now, sleep. You’ve got a long day tomorrow.”\n\nAnd, just like that, I was asleep.\n\n* * *\n\n“Holly!” Mom’s wail startled me awake. Hermes, laying beside me, stretched, yawned and opened his green eyes. “Come on, you two! We don’t want to be late!”\n\nThe toilet flushed in my bathroom and I looked up to see that my bed was empty. A moment later, Tiffany opened the door and peered out, apologetically. “You were sleeping.”\n\nI nodded, got up, glanced to my clock, gasped and rushed into the bathroom. “You go on!”\n\n“Okay,” Tiffany said. She must have gone down the stairs because I heard Mom say, “Good morning!” I zoned out on the rest of the conversation, too busy getting ready.\n\nI was downstairs ten minutes later, Mom shoving a bagel into my hand and rushing me out the door. Tiffany took the front seat again. She was wearing sweats, just like me.

I mean, a human. I was surprised when Anna snuggled in against me. I wrapped my arms around her and listened as her breathing slowed into the gentle sounds of sleep. That was nice.\n\n***\n\nI had nightmares.\n\n“They have stirred,” a man’s voice said.\n\n“Who?” A woman’s sharp voice replied.\n\n“Who else?” the man demanded. “Them. The filth. The horrors.”\n\n“Where?” Another man’s voice — squeakier, nervous — asked.\n\n“America, where else?” the first man replied. “We must find the nest, destroy them before they can grow.”\n\n“They have nothing,” the woman said. “They won’t last against us.”\n\n“If we destroy them now,” the first man declared.\n\n***\n\n“Holly?” Anna’s voice was gasping in my ear. “Holly?”\n\n“What?” I said, pulling myself back from the edge of the nightmare. My phone rang. Tiffany. I got up and pulled it off the desk, getting back under the sheets with Anna. “What?” I said to Tiffany as I answered the phone.\n\n“Did you hear it?” Tiffany said.\n\n“Hear what?”\n\n“The voices,” Anna said in a low tone.\n\nTiffany must have heard her over the phone, because she said, “You heard them too?”\n\n“Yeah,” I said, recalling my nightmare. “I heard them, too.”\n\nThe light snapped on and I closed my eyes against the brightness. “Holly?” It was Mom.\n\n“Voices? Two men, one woman?” I said to her.\n\n“Who are they, Holly?”\n\nI shook my head. I turned and nudged Zeus with my foot. “Zeus?”\n\n“I was sleeping,” Zeus said grumpily.\n\n“No nightmares?”\n\n“No,” Zeus replied.\n\n“None of the dragons,” Mom affirmed. “I didn’t hear what they said, only that they were talking of us.”\n\n“Witches,” Anna said in agreement. “They want to destroy us.”\n\n“Kill us,” a new voice agreed over the phone. It was Tiffany’s mother. “I shall see you all soon. Until then, keep safe.”\n\n“They can’t get here for a while, they don’t know where we are,” I said hopefully.\n\n“Any magic will alert them,” Tiffany’s mother warned. “Any at all.”\n\n“We need to get to the caves,” Zeus grumbled. “We will not survive otherwise.”\n\n“All Saints Hallow,” Tiffany’s mom replied. “That will give us cover.” She handed the phone back to Tiffany who was yawning."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["epub", "continuation", "v1"]}

I knelt down before him and grabbed his chin tightly in my hand, forcing his eyes to meet mine.\n\n“What did you tell him?” I asked, the cold fury in my voice causing him to flinch as if struck.\n\n“Nothing yet, Miss, nothing!” Reynolds swore.\n\n“And what were you going to tell him?”\n\nThe young lad’s eyes drifted from mine, so I tightened my grip on his chin.\n\n“I’ll have that poker,” I said to Mr. MacArdle in a tight, deadly voice.\n\n“You’d never, Miss,” Reynolds said to me with a newly defiant look in his eyes.\n\n“I wouldn’t bet on that, lad,” Mr. MacArdle warned him. I could feel his gaze shift toward me. “I’ve seen others do it.”\n\n“It’s not a question of whether I’ll do it, Reynolds, it’s a question of whether you’ll tell me now or after,” I said to him. I didn’t realize until now how much I hated and feared Hamish MacAllister. I knew the man had designs on me, could recall all the veiled looks he’d sent my way, had heard my father remark on Hamish’s hints that I was ‘ripe for marrying’ and I knew that if ever there was a person I should fear, it was MacAllister. For he’d mount me like a horse and ride me until I was broken and then demand that I work until I collapsed from exhaustion. An evil man, a man never to be trusted. If he knew what I was planning, there’s no telling the trouble — or the blackmail — he could cause.\n\nReynolds saw all that in my eyes. Saw a part of my fears and all of my resolution.

And can I practice?”\n\n“Like, with one of our coins?” I suggested.\n\n“Coins are more difficult to retrieve,” Zeus said.\n\n“Good,” Tiffany and I said in unison.\n\nIt was not good. It was hard. Very hard. We were sweating in minutes and crying in agony an hour later. But we did it.\n\n“I think you should rest now on your laurels,” Zeus said. “You have truly earned them.”\n\nWe had. I’d managed to hide and retrieve coins in my right arm three times. Tiffany had managed six — three in each forearm. And she was the better at pulling them out again. But when she’d suggested hiding one behind her ear, Zeus had been appalled. “Do you want to go deaf?” he’d chided, shaking his head firmly. “No! No, child, don’t think of such things.”\n\nSo we called it a day, just putting magic coins into our arms. Which, come to think of it, was no small deal.\n\nAt dinner that night, Mom and Dad were amazed when we showed off our new skills.

It was over. He’d tried. And failed. Again.\n\nHe got out of the car, beeped it locked, and turned toward the elevators. He stopped as his eyes caught some movement.\n\nA little girl. She was bald and wore a grubby t-shirt and shorts. The shirt read “I ♥ LA.”\n\nI’ve got no time for this, Ryan thought to himself, even as he felt for his wallet. She was obviously in need of help, five bucks ought to do.\n\n“Dr. Ryan?”\n\nRyan stopped, looking down at her in surprise. He hadn’t seen her around before, but her voice seemed familiar. She was tiny, almost shimmering in the night air, but she sounded older than she looked.\n\n“I need your help.”\n\nHe pulled out his wallet and peeled out a five spot, thrusting it toward her. “Here, take this. That should help.”\n\n“It’s not going to be enough.”\n\n“Look, I just lost my job,” Ryan said, stepping around her and punching the call button for the elevator.\n\n“I know.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["epub", "paraphrase", "v1"]}

His last security team had been taken out by a sniper. Egan had survived because the desperate shooter had spent too much time taking out the guards, giving Egan time to run. Even so, the man had gotten off two good shots at him—fortunately only hitting his legs. As they were prosthetic, he didn’t feel a thing.\n\nIgnoring Sanchez, Egan said aloud, “ANGEL, where is Dr. Mackey?”\n\n“Dr. Mackey is upstairs in the control room, Mr. Egan,” a voice spoke quietly in his ear.\n\n“We need to head upstairs,” Egan said.\n\n“Shall I guide you?” the quiet voice spoke again, loud enough for all the bodyguards to hear.\n\n“Please.”\n\n“Spooky,” Sanchez said.\n\n“Hence the name,” the Asian guard, Yushi Takamura, said.

It was well-honed but could do with an extra edge. “Your work inspired us.”\n\n“And the Prince was most impressed,” the other Cameron added, seeming upset that the others had dominated me in conversation.\n\n“Gentlemen, if you’d prefer wait inside, I’m sure Bessie could make you a cup of tea.”\n\n“I’d prefer watch the master at work,” Lieutenant Anderson said gallantly.\n\n“Unless you’d like a cup yourself?” the younger Cameron suggested, looking around the gloomy yard. “Do ye?”\n\n“Well,” I said, trying to hide my blush, “I wouldn’t say no.”\n\nAnd so the younger Cameron strode briskly across the yard to the kitchen while the other two gathered around the sharpening stone, watching intently as I spun it up faster and faster with my foot.\n\nI laid a good fine edge on Lieutenant Anderson’s sword and had started on Captain Cameron’s when the younger Cameron returned with Bessie toting a tray alongside.\n\n“Take a rest, you’ve earned it,” lieutenant Cameron said but I shook my head, “I’ve just started on this blade, it’d be wrong to stop until it’s finished.”\n\nThey all gathered around while I finished up Captain Cameron’s sword and then insisted that I take some tea, “While it’s still warm.”\n\nI was happy to do so and thanked Bessie who looked askance at the three gallant highlanders.

Particularly for ships carrying information. Pirates could catch them, steal their information, and use it for their gain. Which is why most couriers carried a squad of armed men and some even carried small space lasers. Of course, pirates didn’t need live crews if they could get a ship’s computers intact.\n\nDeneb and Meath had made an agreement that they would provide some warships to patrol the normal warp routes. What that usually meant was that a warship would take on the identity of a regular courier — and woe to any pirate that tried to stop them!\n\nSixty-seven ships reported missing or lost. And that was up from forty-eight the year before and thirty-seven the year before that. The only reason they had the data was because it was a standard part of all ships’ downloads — a list of missing ships so that possibly they might be found.\n\nOkay, this is getting nowhere, Cody thought to himself. Do we have any increases in specific routes or —\n\nCody broke off as a display appeared to his left and he saw plots of the reported missing ships as lines in three-dimensional space. All that was known was point of departure and point of non-arrival. Nothing popped out at him.\n\nBut, Ellaz, who had popped up the display, added, here are the same losses ordered by time.\n\nThe view changed. What was particularly alarming was that the older reports were further away from Meath. The newer reports were beyond Deneb in the other direction.\n\nScouts, Cody thought. They sent scouts.\n\nTo steal ships, Other Cody agreed. Cody looked up at him and saw Nora standing beside him, smiling.\n\nWe want to look at the oldest reports, Cody thought.

He could have taken the 405 Freeway—he would have missed some of the slowdown by LAX—but he didn’t care. He needed time to think.\n\nFired! Damn. This was his fifth job in as many years. He’d quit three and now he’d been fired from two.\n\nShit, what did they expect? He’d tried to tell Mackey that what he was doing was experimental, that it required the nanobots, but Mackey was so caught up in Fleet Streets he never got it, always going on about schedules, milestones, and deadlines. When the delivery of the nanobots fell behind schedule, Ryan had tried to get him to slip the Fleet Streets’ schedule to match, but Mackey wouldn’t hear of it.\n\n“I don’t care about your nannies, Ryan,” Mackey had said. “The thing to worry about is Fleet Streets. You deliver on that and you can play with them to your heart’s content.”\n\n“But they’re important!”\n\nMackey had waved him away. Just liked he’d waved Ryan away every other time, too.\n\nWhen the nanobots had finally arrived, Ryan went into a frenzy bringing them on-line. He’d built code that could stand on its own, but he’d known from the start that it wouldn’t be good enough, especially compared to what he’d planned to do with the nanobots. With them wired in, heck with just half of the ten million he’d actually got, he could have managed every one of the vehicles that moved on LA’s streets. Each little nanobot had enough computing power—just—to simulate a car and driver. With ten million of them, he had more than enough to set up the whole problem and build a program that could solve it. Every car, every truck, every bus, every driver in LA was emulated with the software in the nanobots.\n\nIt should have worked. It had worked.

Legs, cables, and the chassis for the second Walker were waiting nearby while the Weasel — who had only been made corporal rather than commissioned as an officer to his disgust and everyone else’s delight — oversaw the work on the timbers for the third.\n\n“We’ll have all four by the end of the week,” Samuel told me, “provided you’ve managed to assemble all the boilers and engines.”\n\nI had, of course. In fact, we were going to be done testing all the engines by the end of the day and I’d come to discuss their transportation to MacAllister’s yard.\n\n“When you’ve got the Scuttler done, bring it over to our yard to pick up the finished equipment.”\n\nSamuel’s eyebrows rose. “That’s quick work!”\n\n“Well, you know how we managed,” I reminded him.

A black cat was perched on his shoulder.\n\n“Ask him his name and see if you still feel that way,” Zeus called back.\n\n“Cat, what’s your name?” Morton said, turning to look into the golden eyes of the jet black cat on his shoulder.

We’re sending Whisper to you directly, she has twelve babies — under three — onboard as well as three crew. As soon as it docks and we get the babies off, it can join us for search and rescue.”\n\n“And the other seventeen?” A new voice piped up. “Danielle Marks, Captain. I’m in charge of SAR.”\n\n“We’ve got a bigger problem,” Nora said, pointing toward the planet. Cody raised an eyebrow. “We need to plot the debris fields from the other habs —”\n\n“Yes, I’m afraid so,” Mayor Hartman agreed. “Our computers are working on it but — could you do better?”\n\n“Our main computer was destroyed with our ship,” Cody said, shaking his head. “We have backups, if we could get a mainframe.”\n\n“What were you using?” Danielle Marks asked.\n\n“We had a Stardyne Mark 30,” Nora replied quickly. Cody gave her a look — as far as he knew they’d been using a Mark 20.\n\n“Will a Mark 40 help?” Danielle replied. “Get your data in, we’ll find a place for it.”\n\n“Okay,” Cody said. “Our other shuttles — those that are empty — we’ll loan for the SAR. Can you crew them?”\n\n“Standard ship shuttles, right?” Danielle asked.\n\n“Yes,” Nora agreed.\n\n“No problem,” Danielle said. “And… Miss…?”\n\n“Sorry,” Cody said, blushing. “Elantra this is my First Officer, Commander Nora Wright.” Then, “Aboard Catalyst we have my Engineering Officers, Lieutenant Commanders Barquess and Ellis. On the third shuttle, Spark, we have my ECLSS officers Lieutenants Wong and Doohan.”\n\n“Also on Wasp,” Nora added, “we have lieutenants Eber and Falcon.”\n\n“All our officers are flight certified,” Cody said, “so they can each take a shuttle.”\n\n“I’ll take Phoenix,” Nora told him.\n\n“We’d like two space qualified people to manage rescues,” Cody said. “When can we get started?”\n\n“What about the hab?” Mayor Hartman said. “What about the debris?”\n\n“Sir,” Danielle said “we’ve got that handled.” Cody could hear the unspoken “we hope” in her tone. “Captain, we have you at ten minutes out, is that correct?”\n\n“Where are we docking?” Cody asked."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["epub", "paraphrase", "v1"]}

The field’s a bit off so compensate on — he tried to recall which segment was the opposite of five. The twenty segments were numbered from zero to nineteen — Segment Fourteen —\n\nKk, Ellaz replied, putting more cooling into the opposite segment. This will make the warp smaller.\n\nOnly a little, Cody thought.\n\nWarp Nine, Ellaz thought a moment later. Fuel!\n\nI see it, Cody replied.

That’s the number one reason ships don’t make it.”\n\n“So these segmented rings, we could put them on regular ships?” Cody wondered.\n\nEdie shook her head. “You’d need a ring watch — at least two ringers — to handle that.” She pursed her lips. “More, if you used two rings.”\n\n“But… why use two?” Ellaz wondered. “I mean, we’ve proven that one works just fine!”\n\n“In sims,” Edie reminded her.\n\n“Well, we’ll know soon enough in five days,” Cody said."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["epub", "paraphrase", "v1"]}

But I didn’t go back to sleep. I got up, showered, got dressed in my school uniform, packed my stuff up and… saw the book on my desk. I frowned at it. And then I hid it under my pillow. If Mom saw it, she’d start asking questions. And I wasn’t ready to answer them.\n\nThe Bug smoked and spluttered up the hill to school. I was worried that we’d get pulled over and cited for smog but Mom kept to the back roads. Whenever she glanced my way, she looked guilty… but determined.\n\nYou know that day when you realize that your mother is human, right? Not a goddess, not a font of all wisdom? Sometimes, even… wrong. Well, that day came early for me. Now, nearly twelve, I was beginning to get a real feel for her moods. There was something suspicious in the way she was acting. Like she had a plan.\n\nNow, some of my mother’s plans are the most amazing, gorgeous, and joyful things that have ever happened to me. Others… not so much.\n\nSo I had to ask myself, why was Mom driving me to school? What was —\n\n“What are you up to?” I said as we turned to join the long row of cars waiting to crawl to the drop off.\n\n“I just thought you needed a break, that’s all,” Mom said defensively. “Can’t a mother want to look out for her daughter?”\n\nOh yeah! She was being sneaky.\n\n“I think that’s marvelous,” I told her. Two can play at this game!\n\n“So, your birthday is coming up,” Mom said as we idled — and belched smoke — in line.\n\n“Yes,” I agreed. I could have gone full out sarcastic but… well, Mom. She was all I had. I was all she had. Maybe I could have been different if my Dad were around. I don’t know. All I have of him are pictures.\n\n“I was thinking, Halloween’s coming up soon,” Mom began.\n\nI flinched. I was born September 6th. Halloween was not even close. But when Mom pulled the ‘Halloween’ tactic, I knew where she was going. We had a magic shop, we had a party room.

I looked at the display. It was Natasha Taylor. I held the phone up so that Tiffany — and the cat — could see. Tiffany gasped. I clicked on the phone. “Hello?”\n\n“Are you coming?” Natasha said hastily. “I’m here at the store — and there’s no one inside. Are you coming?”\n\nI glanced at the time. “We open at ten on Sundays,” I told her. “I imagine Mom —”\n\nThump, thump, thump, thump! “Girls, are you coming?”\n\n“Natasha Taylor’s on the phone, Mom,” I called through the door. “She’s at the shop.”\n\n“Oh!” Mom said. “Well, did you —”\n\n“I told her we don’t open until ten,” I shouted back. Tiffany sat up in the bed, grinning.\n\n“Good!” Mom called. “Are you coming?”\n\nI looked over to Tiffany and raised an eyebrow. Then I pointed to my room and gave her a questioning look. She thought it over and nodded.\n\n“We’re going to stay here,” I said. “Can we have Natasha over, though?”\n\n“Sure,” Mom said, slowly. “Just as long as you don’t destroy the place and do your —”\n\n“Homework,” I finished for her. “Sure!” I turned back to the phone. “Natasha? Do you want to come here? To my house? Tiffany’s with me.”\n\n“She is?” Natasha was surprised. “And your place? Are you sure?”\n\nI nodded and glanced to Tiffany who also nodded. “Sure!

Being Monday, Dad and I had stayed for fencing and so got back closer to six than usual. So we made dinner and had it ready when Mom got home. She glanced to me and said again, “What obligations?”\n\nI shrugged. Dad shrugged. Zeus gloated.\n\n“He’s being a stinker,” Hera said. “He never did like feeling obligated to anyone.”\n\n“So these are your obligations?” I said to Zeus. I’d even fed him tuna!\n\n“So much of our memories are lost,” Hera said. “They could be his, they could be some sort of magic… I don’t even think he knows!”\n\n“So, if you lose these obligations,” I said, “does that mean you’ll leave?”\n\n“I will not be obligated to stay,” Zeus replied. “Nor will my mate or children.”\n\n“Uh-huh,” I said, glancing to Mom and Dad.\n\n“Let’s leave it,” Dad said, winking at me when Zeus couldn’t see.\n\nA moment later, Erich thought to me, Your father says that he thinks Zeus is confused and we shouldn’t worry.\n\nA confused dragon and I shouldn’t worry?

Powerful. Menacing.\n\nBrian moved up to it, opened his backpack and pulled out a large piece of plastic. A tarpaulin.

I nodded and got out more of the ‘special delivery.’ “Put one cone, one rose, and one thorn on each of the pegs.”\n\nWe spread out and got it done.\n\n“The pine oil?” Brian said to me, holding out his hand.

When the delivery of the nanobots fell behind schedule, Ryan had tried to get him to slip the Fleet Streets’ schedule to match, but Mackey wouldn’t hear of it.\n\n“I don’t care about your nannies, Ryan,” Mackey had said. “The thing to worry about is Fleet Streets. You deliver on that and you can play with them to your heart’s content.”\n\n“But they’re important!”\n\nMackey had waved him away. Just liked he’d waved Ryan away every other time, too.\n\nWhen the nanobots had finally arrived, Ryan went into a frenzy bringing them on-line. He’d built code that could stand on its own, but he’d known from the start that it wouldn’t be good enough, especially compared to what he’d planned to do with the nanobots. With them wired in, heck with just half of the ten million he’d actually got, he could have managed every one of the vehicles that moved on LA’s streets. Each little nanobot had enough computing power—just—to simulate a car and driver. With ten million of them, he had more than enough to set up the whole problem and build a program that could solve it. Every car, every truck, every bus, every driver in LA was emulated with the software in the nanobots.\n\nIt should have worked. It had worked. It had worked for a while and then—what the hell had happened? Where had the nanobots gone? Had someone taken them?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["epub", "summary", "v1"]}

But, with Cali, Jasmine outscored him. In the end, he stepped back and raised his foil in salute.\n\nShe was good, Cali said. She is a bit jealous, though.\n\nWho wouldn’t be? I said.\n\nShe doesn’t know my true name, Cali said.\n\nTiffany had helped with Carla and Emily when Jasmine had come over to fence with Dad. Now she came back to me while Dad went to work with the rest of the team, coaching and encouraging.\n\nFinally, we were out of time and Dad sent us back to the lockers. Tiffany and I used our chance to sheath our blades back into our arms, each grinning at the other.\n\n“I have got to do that!” Jasmine said when she spotted us.\n\n“I think Zeus has gear picked out for you,” I told her.\n\n“Will the blade talk to me?” Jasmine asked.\n\nI frowned and shook my head. “Zeus says that takes a lot more work,” I said. “I was just lucky to find this one.”\n\nJasmine snorted in agreement and went to change.\n\n***\n\nDad let me stay after school. We also had Tiffany, Anna, and Jasmine with us. We spent some time teaching Jasmine the spells we knew so she could help. She also learned Sheath and decided to sheath her foil in her left hip. She also asked Zeus to teach her how to make her blade talk but was willing to accept Zeus’ statement that it would take years. Jasmine recognized that we had more pressing issues and let the matter drop.\n\n“You know, everyone’s going to want it,” I said to Zeus when Jasmine left us alone. Then I had a thought, “Could we teach the swords to talk to each other?”\n\n“There are easier ways to achieve the same ends,” Zeus said. He nodded toward my back pocket where I kept my cellphone.\n\n“Well, it was so cool when Eric could talk to everyone,” I said.\n\n“And dangerous,” Zeus said. I gave him a look. “In the wrong hands, Eric’s ability could have incapacitated everyone.”\n\nBetween the four of us — Dad stayed upstairs in the Library grading papers — we managed to make twenty-four more magic items."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["epub", "continuation", "v1"]}

He sent Doc to provide him light. He found a bright red emergency pod lying on the ground just a meter from the airlock. He peered down at it and saw a dark shape inside. He scanned the readings on the pod… it was losing power, running out of air.\n\n“The pod’s almost out of power,” Cody said. He reached down, picked it up and hooked it to his suit harness. “Heading back.”\n\n“Cody, what if this is a trap?” Steve asked. “I mean, you’re the admiral. If they caught you —”\n\n“Steve, do we detect any other vessels?” Cody said, stepping out of the airlock and pushing himself off the crippled shuttle. He ordered Doc to tow him back to his shuttle’s airlock.\n\nThinking quickly, he hooked the emergency pod onto Doc and had the bot follow him into the airlock. It was crowded. Too crowded. Reluctantly, Cody ordered Doc to leave him with the pod. Then he cycled the lock. Before he walked into his shuttle, he canceled the artificial gravity — no point in trying to lug an awkward pod until he had to.\n\nHe pulled the pod to the rear of the shuttle, near the tiny medical bay. He lowered the pod to the ground and held a hand on it to keep it from bouncing back.\n\n“I’m turning on the gravity,” Cody shouted in warning, dialing up the gravity to half a gee.\n\nThere was a moan and a shriek from inside the pod. And then nothing.\n\nCody leaned down, hit the emergency release on the pod. Nothing. Shit. Cody searched around the med bay desperately until he found a knife — a surgical blade. He knelt down by the pod, pressed against it to be sure that he wasn’t going to press into the body inside and then stabbed the pod. He worked quickly because it started sagging the moment he’d burst the fabric. He cut and cut until he could reach inside. He felt around gently. A nose. There. He cut further and further, racing around the face to cradle the skull. It lolled against his hand, either too weak or… Cody cut faster.\n\n“I’ve got you,” Cody said comfortingly, “I’ve got you.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["epub", "summary", "v1"]}

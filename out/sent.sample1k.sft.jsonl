Rowling is alsoa Christmas \ncrime story.  In fact, multiple crimes are attempted, several \ncommitted.  At Christmas, Harry receives mysteriously an invisibility \ncloak which enables him to perform many capers and ultimately to track \ndown the criminal who wants to steal the philosopher’s stone.  At which \npoint, Lord Voldemort, co-inhabiting the body of Professor Quirrell, \nattempts murder.  Harry survives.  This is another example of a \nfeel-good story.\n\nThe next book, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secretsis also holiday \nrelated (Halloween), as is the fourth (Harry Potter and the Goblet of \nFire) which reprises the Yule holiday.  And, of course, all the books \ninvolve unsuccessful attempts to murder Harry Potter.\n\nAnd, just now, I realized that an old favorite, Donna Andrews’ Murder \nwith Peacocks,centers upon three weddings and a murder.  This is another \nexample of murder and attempted murder. Also an example of a feel-good \nstory.*"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["email", "draft_or_rewrite", "v1"]}

How's it going?\n\nOver here, we're hanging in. We're worried about the delta variant, \nparticularly because Brit's doctor has told her specifically NOT to get \nthe vaccine -- it might make things much worse for her.\n\nAs it is, Brit will be heading back to LA to see an eye doctor at UCLA \nbecause in the past several weeks she's noticed two very troubling \nthings: her hearing has gotten worse and her eyesight has gotten worse.  \nA good retinal doctor here in Vegas detected signs of thinning in the \noptic nerve.  Not good.  Brit took the news in stride.  She's hoping \nthat it's Usher's Type 3 because then she'll have a diagnosis.  It also \nhelps that the eye doctor in UCLA has seen her before, willingly calls \n*her* and is also the guy who originally determined the existence of \nUsher's Type 3. Anyway, we cross fingers.  In the meantime, Brit has got \nhearing aids and loves being able to hear things she didn't notice for \nthe past five years -- like being able to hear her nails tapping on things.\n\nI am busy writing a sequel to a novel I just completed.  The first \nnovel, RAW SPACE, is out with alpha readers.  You know, nothing out of \nthe ordinary, just a space opera where someone has planted zombie sex \nbugs on the Fleet's laundry ship ;)\n\nI hope you're doing well.\n\nLove,\n\nTodd"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["email", "draft_or_rewrite", "v1"]}

Here is the situation.\n    The A/C system is one condenser with two internal thermostats, one\n    upstairs and one down stairs. There is a damper, which is movable flap\n    inside the duct work that directs air flow downstair or upstairs\n    depending on the settings of the thermostat.\n\n    At some point in time in the past one of the thermostats was\n    disconnected and so the damper does not adjust airflow, since there is\n    only one thermostat attached.\n\n    I would like to get the second thermostat reconnected and confirm the\n    damper is working correctly to cool both floors as soon as possible.\n\n    As it is right now, the AC is running continuously. Even when the\n    system\n    is turned OFF, the fans still run. When the system is set to COOL, the\n    thermostat setting downstairs has no effect -- and the system runs\n    continuously, without regards to temperature (the temperature has been\n    68 when the thermostat was set to 72), nothing short of turning the AC\n    to OFF on the thermostat effects that (and, as I said, even then the\n    fans continue to run). None of this can be good for the AC system.\n\n    At this very moment, my room temperature is 79.3 degrees which is\n    intolerable.\n\n    I look forward to hearing from you immediately.\n\n    Sincerely,\n    Todd McCaffrey"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["email", "fields", "v1"]}

Feel free to share with Eliza. I'll write more as I get the \ntime. (I'm still REALLY sad about Chadwick Boseman - his is a great loss.)\n\nWe grew up in several locations in the US, all in the northeast:\n\n 1.\n\n    Montclair, NJ.  I left when I was two and have no memories.\n\n 2.\n\n    100 Danforth Place, Windybush, Wilmington, Delaware\n\n     1.\n\n        With one interruption, we lived there from the time I was 2\n        (1958) until we moved to 369 Carpenter Ave., Sea Cliff, Long\n        Island, NY in 1965\n\n 3.\n\n    369 Carpenter Avenue, Sea Cliff, Long Island, New York\n\n     1.\n\n        We lived there from 1965 until we (Gigi, Mum, and I) moved to\n        Ireland in 1970\n\n 4.\n\n    In Ireland (just to continue the record), we first lived in:\n\n     1.\n\n          14 North Avenue, Mount Merrion (1970-71)\n\n     2.\n\n        Meadowbrook House, Dundrum (1971-72)\n\n         1.\n\n            Alec joined us there and became a trawler fisherman.\n\n     3.\n\n        Site 11 Rochestown Avenue (1972-73)\n\n         1.\n\n            Alec wasn’t here\n\n     4.\n\n        79 Shanganagh Vale, Cabinteely (1973-1979?)\n\n         1.\n\n            Nor was Alec here.\n\n     5.\n\n        Dragonhold, Kilquade, Co. Wicklow (1979-1987)\n\n         1.\n\n            He visited here occasionally\n\n     6.\n\n         From there, Mum moved into Dragonhold-Underhill and lived there\n        until she died in 2011.\n\nI have many memories of Alec, some of which are great and some of which \nare not.\n\nWhen we were in 100 Danforth, we all got kittens: Tasso (Alec), Tallabar \n(me), and Silkie Blackington (for Gigi with much adult supervision in \nthe naming else the cat would have been simply “Blackie”).\n\nTasso was a tortoise shell.  He lost an argument with a car not long \nafter we got him. Alec was devastated.\n\nTallabar was a multi-color, a mix of grays and oranges.  Quite the \npretty cat.\n\nSilkie was your average black cat.  She was sweet and her fur was very \nsoft, hence the name.\n\nSilkie and Tallabar went on to have many, many litters.  Tallabar was \ngood at producing orange marmalade cats.\n\nWe also had dogs, starting with Wizard (a German Shepherd) followed by \nhis son, Merlin.  Wiz decided that I was his human charge. We had a \nsloping hill outside our front door and it went down to join the street \nwhich formed part of the branches of a tee-junction (the other street \ntee’d into Danforth Place).  Wiz decided that I was not allowed to go \ndown that hill when I was an infant and took to blocking me.\n\nOur next door neighbors (to our left as you’re standing in the front \ndoor looking out) were the Estes.  Larry Estes was Alec’s age.  I think \ntheir daughter was close to Gigi’s age.  Alec and Larry hung out and I \ndid my best to tag along, often successfully.\n\nThere was another housing estate being built across the railroad tracks \nbeyond a small woods at the edge of Windybush and we used to trek there \nmany a  time. The woods had some pretty decent undergrowth. One day \nLarry got a hold of his father’s machete (from WWII) and he and Alec \ntook turns “clearing” the underbrush (think Indiana Jones in South \nAmerica at the beginning of Raiders of the Lost Ark).  I must have been \naround six.  At one point Alec told me to stand back.  I did but, \napparently, not far enough and the machete tore into my shin.  I think \nit was Alec who carried me back to the house. I went to the ER and got \nfour stitches.\n\nAnother  time, when I was eight or so, we had a particularly hard but \ndry winter.  It was decided to go exploring (“mountain climbing”?) in \nthe culverts at the upper side of the estate.  Alec had brought a hammer \nalong to poke holes in the ice as handholds.  He told me (seems to be a \npattern here) to get back and swung immediately after I said, “Okay” but \nbefore I could comply (well, that’s my story) and I got the claws of the \nhammer hitting my head -- just on the eye socket.  A bit lower and I \nwould have lost the eye.  As it was, I got two stitches without novocaine.\n\nAh, the good years!\n\nAlec and I fought often enough that I have many recollections of \nvariously being forced to eat grass or dirt to escape being buried under \nhim.\n\nIn 1962 we moved to Dusseldorf, Germany for six months because Dad had a \njob doing PR work for DuPont that required him to work there.  Overall, \nit was a marvelous experience.  Alec, Gigi, and I were all very \nnordic-looking and, when we didn’t speak, had no trouble passing for \nGerman (Dad’s family had roots in Schleswig-Holstein on the \nGerman-Danish border).  Mum place Alec and I in the local German \nschool.  I can’t say how well Alec did but I flourished, having a \nteacher who could speak English (she was raised in England during the \nwar) and I learned excellent “gekauft Deutsch” -- as Mum called it \n(“shopping German”).\n\nWe all adored the chocolate over there.  We took the tram everywhere, \nun-parented.  I recall once having some old Frau look at us and scoff, \n“Ach, Englander!” to which I replied, “Nein, Amerikaner!” -- that seemed \nto both affront and appease her, somewhat (the English had ruled the \narea after the war and weren’t particularly good at it).\n\nThey had these marvelous parades where they’d throw candy.  We all loved \nthat.\n\nWe got a VW station wagon while we were over there and, when our time \nwas up, drove around Europe (France, Germany, Holland, at least).  We \ntook the ferry to England.  We were broke, so we camped one night all in \nthe VW and discovered later the next day that we’d stopped outside an \ninsane asylum.  We dropped the car off for transport to the States and \nheaded to Gatwick airport (Heathrow was not then built), only to \ndiscover that there was some tax that we still had to pay before we \ncould board the flight back.  This caused the parents immense distress \nuntil a nice American couple, hearing the panic, loaned us the money \n(there were Texans).\n\n*"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["email", "actions", "v1"]}

I'd rather like winning outright but I'll work on it.\n\nI'm glad that you added your voice on the Hungarian translator. I quite \nagree that Mum would get a kick out of the whole thing and would be \nactively PUSHING to get it done.\n\nI have a fan wondering if there'll be any more Tower & Hive books and \nanother wondering if there'll be more Doona books.\n\nAt 20BooksTo50k I chatted with Kevin Ikenberry, another writer and, it \nturns out a retired LTC from the Army.  He's teaching the guys at \nSpaceforce. We were talking about writing a series set out on the \nAsteroid Belt as I believe that's the next great frontier and we should \nget into it (as a species) so writing about it might help the movement, \nas it were.\n\nAny collaborations like that will wait until I get the six (hopefully no \nmore) books in the Canaris Rift series done.  I just recently did a new \ncover which I decided I'd use for the fourth book, /Pirate Queen/, which \nis right now at 18,000+ words.\n\nThe Twins got a really cool write-up in the local newspaper, The Las \nVegas Review-Journal \n<https://www.reviewjournal.com/rj-magazine/amazing-stories-of-the-unbelievable-sci-fi-sisters-2474997/>.  \nYou can read it by following the link.\n\nWe're thinking that our next major convention will be WonderCon in April \n2022 (Anaheim Convention Center, just across the street from Disney).  \nMaybe you should consider coming, see what working a booth is like, get \nout and see the weirdness that is a comic-con (and then do Disney to \nrecover <g>).  I'm sure that tons of fans would love to meet you, and \nyou'd be surprised at how rewarding it is to interact with them.\n\nAfter WonderCon, it's Writers of the Future the very next weekend!

Recently I was asked to \nthink back to a time when I was inspired by a book and upon thinking \nabout all the books I have read. I remembered yours. It took me a couple \ndays of searching to find and remember your book and I was so happy when \nI finally found it and bought it because over the years I do not know \nwhere my original copy went sadly and it was even signed by the two of \nyou. I am not asking for another signed book I just felt that I should \nreach out and share a good, happy memory I have because of the two of \nyou. I hope all is well during these uncertain times. I look forward to \nrereading your book and getting to relive the moment as a child when I \nread it for the first time. Thank you for time and reading this \nlengthily message. Take care and stay safe during this pandemic.

Hope this email finds you well, it's been awhile, and \nI pray we all get to meet up at conventions again. <sigh>\n\nIn the meantime, please forgive my shameless promotion here. I'm gunning \nfor recommendations for my last History channel videogame, /Project Blue \nBook/ with little or no guidance and have drummed up this post on the \nSFWA board. For amplification purposes I am sending it out to certain \nSFWA members who may be interested in playing and/or reading the game's \nscript for consideration. Hope you won't mind being on my list. Did you \nhappen to catch the TV series? Well worth watching.\n\nHere is an overview of *Project Blue Book: The Game* with the attached \ngame script for your consideration (as well as some smaller samples) and \nlinks to play the game for free. Enjoy!\n\nThe information below has been posted in its entirety on the Members \nOnly SFWA message boards at the following link, and should be treated \nconfidentially: \nhttps://www.sfwa.org/forum/topic/15951-project-blue-book-the-game-by-steven-elliot-altman-and-julie-marsh/ \n<https://www.sfwa.org/forum/topic/15951-project-blue-book-the-game-by-steven-elliot-altman-and-julie-marsh/>\n\nProject Blue Book The Game Image 2.png\n\nProject Blue Book: The Game by Steven-Elliot Altman and Julie Marsh\n\nPlease find attached the Final Production Draft of Project Blue Book: \nThe Game, which I wrote for A&E Networks based on their History Channel \nseries, along with my clue writer Julie Marsh (Julie was not credited on \nthe game itself, as I was featured, but I am compelled to include her \nfor consideration due to her essential contributions).\n\nI was attempting to bring the genres of television writing and videogame \nwriting one step closer. I was given nearly free reign by the network \nand showrunners on how to proceed, and so decided to write my own \nadaptations of half the game's cases based on produced episodes of the \nTV series (with additional scenes that I envisioned) and the other half \nof the cases as original cases which I based on actual declassified \nU.S.A.F Project Blue Book files.\n\nThe Production Draft encompasses all 9 Cases of Season One of the game. \nBecause this document is quite lengthy I have also attached \"Case 105: \nThe Aztec Recovery\" (in which I introduce J. Robert Oppenheimer to the \ngame's story) and \"Case 107: Project Rainbow\" (in which I \nintroduce Albert Einstein to the game's story, in a story previously \ndramatized as the feature film /The Philadelphia Experiment/) as two \nsmaller samples of the complete work.\n\nBesides the script, the game is FREE TO PLAY as a mobile app available \nfor both IOS and Android phones and tablets in the safe links listed \nbelow, and I invite you to play!\n\nProject Blue Book: The Game on IOS \n<https://apps.apple.com/us/app/project-blue-book-the-game/id1445162277>\n\nProject Blue Book: The Game on Android \n<https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.threegates.projectbluebook&hl=en_US>\n\nAnd for anyone who does not wish to actually play the game, here are \ntwo youtube videos posted by players that depict the game's opening \ntutorial, and the start of CASE 101, The Fuller Dogfight.\n\nProject Blue Book Opening Cut Scene and Tutorial \n<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFhBUpUeqsE&t=5s>\n\nProject Blue Book Case 101 Walkthrough \n<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOhAgdjG7bY&t=23s>\n\nAnd finally, here is the approved description from the app store:\n\nProject Blue Book: The Game is the official, free-to-play, hidden object \nadventure game based on HISTORY’s hit drama series PROJECT BLUE BOOK, \ncreated by David O'Leary, and executive produced by Academy Award and \nGolden Globe® winner Robert Zemeckis. The series explores the \nhistorical, Top Secret investigations into UFOs conducted by the U.S. \nAir Force between 1952 and 1969.\n\nIn Project Blue Book: The Game, you will start off as a newly recruited \nagent in Project Blue Book during the 1950s, under the guidance of the \nshow's lead investigators, Dr. J. Allen Hynek (played by Aidan Gillen \nfrom “Game Of Thrones”), and Captain Michael Quinn (played by Michael \nMalarkey from “The Vampire Diaries”), and begin to investigate real \ndeclassified UFO investigations to find the truth!\n\nHundreds of puzzles, witness interviews and hidden object scenes will \nchallenge your observation and deduction tactics as you investigate \nalongside your favorite characters into many of the cases you loved from \nthe series, uncover exclusive new content, and explore new cases that \ncan only be found in the game! The game's story is written by \nbestselling science-fiction writer and award-winning game writer \nSteven-Elliot Altman, best known for similar social games like PEARL’S \nPERIL and ANCIENT ALIENS.\n\nWe're here to find the truth! So, come help us investigate flying \nsaucers along with Dr. Hynek in the world's first Unidentified Flying \n(Hidden) Object Game!\n\nThank you for considering *Project Blue Book: The Game* for a Nebula \nNomination in the best game writing category.

It’s lovely of you to check in, and probably couldn’t come \nat a better time.\nYou asked, so I ain’t gonna hold back. Tune in your big brother \nlistening ears cause your baby sister needs sound advice. I have to \nadmit, I’m not doing too well. Wish I could fluff away, all light and \nbreezy, and tell you ‘I’m grand’ but I’m not. I guess it’s a combination \nof things but, predominantly, living on my own, away from the area I’ve \nknown for over 40 years, is incredibly hard and seems to magnify any \nother difficult issues I experience in my life as a single 60-something. \nIt’s like I’m starting all over again, when I’m already starting over \nagain since my marriage ended. The property market here is a mess, with \nhouses selling far above asking price because there’s a scarcity of \nstock for sale, so I can’t afford to buy anything now and lay down new \nroots. The holding pattern I’m in is excruciating!\n\nAnd I guess other aspects of my life, and the seemingly never-ending \ncrises that are engulfing the earth, are all mixing together to fill my \nplate with a gloomy looking repast. I should stop reading the news.\n\nSleep is difficult; I’ve been wide awake for an hour and it’s not yet \n5am, so this day’s store of resilience is already fecked up. - I have to \ngo to Owen’s girlfriend’s place today to help celebrate the “gender \nreveal” (slap me quick before I gag!) they have planned now that their \ngestating baby is 3 months along. It’ll be the first time I’ll be in the \nsame air space as Geoff since we were in court getting our divorce \ndecree; when I bawled my eyes out in front of everyone whilst giving \ntestimony. Oy! Added to that, Owen has, frankly, been treating me like a \npiece of shit over the last few months so the strain is telling. I’ll be \na big girl, though, go along to see what sex the baby will be and try to \nsmile a lot.\n\nAbout two weeks ago Geoff’s youngest sister, Edel, the main carer for my \n(ex?) mother-in-law, Joan, was in a terrible car crash while travelling \nto Cork for a weekend break with her boyfriend. She’s broken the bones \nin the top of her foot, and two vertebrae just above the tailbone. She \nliterally broke her arse. Poor Mick, her boyfriend, is far worse off and \nwill remain in hospital in Cork for at least another 6 weeks, undergoing \nanother couple of surgeries on top of the 3 he’s already had. Fuck! What \na nightmare, and no visitors allowed to see him. Poor guy.\n\nAnd then a totally strange series of things have occurred recently with \nregard to my late sister-in-law’s husband, Noel. He’s a very successful \nbusinessman and a pub owner and has been trying to cope with the sudden \ndeath of his wife in June 2019, along with the grief their two (young) \nadult kids are experiencing, plus the lack of pub business due to Covid.\n\nI’ve kept in loose touch with Noel ever since he asked me to write and \ndeliver Maria’s eulogy. Over the last couple of years, through texts, \nhe’s always suggested that we get together for a drink and catch up \nwhich I’ve always put down as pure politeness. Recently he suggested the \nsame thing but in a phone call when he told me about Edel’s crash, which \nno one else in the Kennedy clan had informed me of.\n\nEdel has always been close to Noel and she asked him to drive to Cork to \nbe with her whilst she gave an official report to the Gardai regarding \nthe crash. So here’s where it gets weird, Tig. Noel asked me to drive \nwith him to Cork to collect Edel but suggested we go down the day before \nher release, have a nice meal, a few drinks and “a laugh”, and stay the \nnight in an hotel before we retrieve Edel the following day. Whilst he \nwas suggesting this plan I was uncommonly quiet on the other end of the \nphone and Noel said we would, of course, have separate rooms because he \n“wasn’t going to try and climb into bed with me”. The thought never \ncrossed my mind! To be honest, I wasn’t sure what the fuck was going on \nbut it’s been a very long time since I’ve been in the company of a kind \nman who wanted to hang out with me, so I agreed, thinking what harm \ncould come of it.\n\nAt any rate, as it turned out, Edel didn’t have to have an interview \nwith the Gardai in Cork and without discussing it with me, Noel changed \nhis initial plan ‘to have a laugh’, and we simply drove to and from Cork \non the same day to collect Edel. I reckon he possibly had a good think \nabout what he’d proposed and decided against it. We had a pleasant time \ntalking on the way down to Cork but I couldn’t forget the fact that I’m \nfairly certain he’d possibly made a pass at me. Or did he? I have no clue.\n\nSo my silly girl head can’t stop thinking about this, and Noel. In fact, \nit’s wrecking my head, and living alone doesn’t help; I already spend \n*way* too much time in my own head. I keep scolding myself to stop! but \nI’m lonely, and would like a man to like me again. I guess I’m just \ngoing to have to let time do it’s magical thing and allow it all to \nslowly fade away. Talk to me, Todd. Give me your take on this. Sorry \nthis is so long but, hell! I’m long-winded.\n\nLove,\nSkin\n\nSent from my iPad"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["email", "intent", "v1"]}

Her mounting anger and vengeance didn't have any \nrational background to support them and her unwillingness to listen to \nreason or learn finally killed any sympathy I might have had for her.\n\nI also questioned the setting -- was this in the 1970s? 80s? 90s? \nEarlier? Later?\n\nGinny's love for her mare didn't work for me. I grew up with horse mad \ngirls, and Ginny didn't fit.  It seemed to me that her horse was at \nabout the same level in her affections as a rusted hand-me-down bicycle.\n\nI began to notice the number of chapters.  There's an *awful* lot of them.\n\nI also wasn't sure about the farm -- was it a cattle farm? Dairy? Crop? \nMixed use?  That question nagged at me and helped pull me out of the book.\n\nCheers,\nTodd McCaffrey\n\nP.S.: The YA/Middle Grade books that I read include:\n\nAlly Carter's /The Gallagher Girls/ \n<https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000S1LF5K>\nalso Ally Carter's Winterborne Home for Vengeance and Valor \n<https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07T4HQR9D>\nAlan Bradley started a marvelous series about an eleven year-old sleuth \nwith The Sweetness at the Bottom of the Pie \n<https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0027G6XDS>\nL.A. Meyer produced the amazing Bloody Jack \n<https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003K16PPU> series.\nAlso, Carlos Hernandez knocked it out of the park with Sal and Gabi \nBreak the Universe <https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FL82MKG> which is \ncurrently an Amazon #1 Best Seller"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["email", "actions", "v1"]}

Here is the situation.\n    The A/C system is one condenser with two internal thermostats, one\n    upstairs and one down stairs. There is a damper, which is movable flap\n    inside the duct work that directs air flow downstair or upstairs\n    depending on the settings of the thermostat.\n\n    At some point in time in the past one of the thermostats was\n    disconnected and so the damper does not adjust airflow, since there is\n    only one thermostat attached.\n\n    I would like to get the second thermostat reconnected and confirm the\n    damper is working correctly to cool both floors as soon as possible.\n\n    As it is right now, the AC is running continuously. Even when the\n    system\n    is turned OFF, the fans still run. When the system is set to COOL, the\n    thermostat setting downstairs has no effect -- and the system runs\n    continuously, without regards to temperature (the temperature has been\n    68 when the thermostat was set to 72), nothing short of turning the AC\n    to OFF on the thermostat effects that (and, as I said, even then the\n    fans continue to run). None of this can be good for the AC system.\n\n    At this very moment, my room temperature is 79.3 degrees which is\n    intolerable.\n\n    I look forward to hearing from you immediately.\n\n    Sincerely,\n    Todd McCaffrey"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["email", "intent", "v1"]}

I'm gunning \nfor recommendations for my last History channel videogame, /Project Blue \nBook/ with little or no guidance and have drummed up this post on the \nSFWA board. For amplification purposes I am sending it out to certain \nSFWA members who may be interested in playing and/or reading the game's \nscript for consideration. Hope you won't mind being on my list. Did you \nhappen to catch the TV series? Well worth watching.\n\nHere is an overview of *Project Blue Book: The Game* with the attached \ngame script for your consideration (as well as some smaller samples) and \nlinks to play the game for free. Enjoy!\n\nThe information below has been posted in its entirety on the Members \nOnly SFWA message boards at the following link, and should be treated \nconfidentially: \nhttps://www.sfwa.org/forum/topic/15951-project-blue-book-the-game-by-steven-elliot-altman-and-julie-marsh/ \n<https://www.sfwa.org/forum/topic/15951-project-blue-book-the-game-by-steven-elliot-altman-and-julie-marsh/>\n\nProject Blue Book The Game Image 2.png\n\nProject Blue Book: The Game by Steven-Elliot Altman and Julie Marsh\n\nPlease find attached the Final Production Draft of Project Blue Book: \nThe Game, which I wrote for A&E Networks based on their History Channel \nseries, along with my clue writer Julie Marsh (Julie was not credited on \nthe game itself, as I was featured, but I am compelled to include her \nfor consideration due to her essential contributions).\n\nI was attempting to bring the genres of television writing and videogame \nwriting one step closer. I was given nearly free reign by the network \nand showrunners on how to proceed, and so decided to write my own \nadaptations of half the game's cases based on produced episodes of the \nTV series (with additional scenes that I envisioned) and the other half \nof the cases as original cases which I based on actual declassified \nU.S.A.F Project Blue Book files.\n\nThe Production Draft encompasses all 9 Cases of Season One of the game. \nBecause this document is quite lengthy I have also attached \"Case 105: \nThe Aztec Recovery\" (in which I introduce J. Robert Oppenheimer to the \ngame's story) and \"Case 107: Project Rainbow\" (in which I \nintroduce Albert Einstein to the game's story, in a story previously \ndramatized as the feature film /The Philadelphia Experiment/) as two \nsmaller samples of the complete work.\n\nBesides the script, the game is FREE TO PLAY as a mobile app available \nfor both IOS and Android phones and tablets in the safe links listed \nbelow, and I invite you to play!\n\nProject Blue Book: The Game on IOS \n<https://apps.apple.com/us/app/project-blue-book-the-game/id1445162277>\n\nProject Blue Book: The Game on Android \n<https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.threegates.projectbluebook&hl=en_US>\n\nAnd for anyone who does not wish to actually play the game, here are \ntwo youtube videos posted by players that depict the game's opening \ntutorial, and the start of CASE 101, The Fuller Dogfight.\n\nProject Blue Book Opening Cut Scene and Tutorial \n<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFhBUpUeqsE&t=5s>\n\nProject Blue Book Case 101 Walkthrough \n<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOhAgdjG7bY&t=23s>\n\nAnd finally, here is the approved description from the app store:\n\nProject Blue Book: The Game is the official, free-to-play, hidden object \nadventure game based on HISTORY’s hit drama series PROJECT BLUE BOOK, \ncreated by David O'Leary, and executive produced by Academy Award and \nGolden Globe® winner Robert Zemeckis. The series explores the \nhistorical, Top Secret investigations into UFOs conducted by the U.S. \nAir Force between 1952 and 1969.\n\nIn Project Blue Book: The Game, you will start off as a newly recruited \nagent in Project Blue Book during the 1950s, under the guidance of the \nshow's lead investigators, Dr. J. Allen Hynek (played by Aidan Gillen \nfrom “Game Of Thrones”), and Captain Michael Quinn (played by Michael \nMalarkey from “The Vampire Diaries”), and begin to investigate real \ndeclassified UFO investigations to find the truth!\n\nHundreds of puzzles, witness interviews and hidden object scenes will \nchallenge your observation and deduction tactics as you investigate \nalongside your favorite characters into many of the cases you loved from \nthe series, uncover exclusive new content, and explore new cases that \ncan only be found in the game! The game's story is written by \nbestselling science-fiction writer and award-winning game writer \nSteven-Elliot Altman, best known for similar social games like PEARL’S \nPERIL and ANCIENT ALIENS.\n\nWe're here to find the truth! So, come help us investigate flying \nsaucers along with Dr. Hynek in the world's first Unidentified Flying \n(Hidden) Object Game!\n\nThank you for considering *Project Blue Book: The Game* for a Nebula \nNomination in the best game writing category.

It doesn’t just come from our parents. It comes from our \ncommunity, our society, from the people we grow up with.\n\nI am an alien, so I think my point of view may be helpful. When I say \nI’m an alien, I’m an alien in Ireland: where I lived for my high school \nand college years. I describe myself as “mid-Atlantic and sinking.”\n\nMy journey toward racism started in late elementary and early middle \nschool, before I moved to Ireland.\n\nI moved to Long Island, New York, in time to enter third grade. The \nschool was small and the community tight-knit. There were only two black \nkids in the whole school — they were brothers, a year apart. Nice guys. \nThe younger one had a small bit of iris detached in the white of his eye \nwhich amazed everyone who saw it.  I remember constantly asking to look \nat it — it was just so cool!\n\nMy parents were determined to raise broad-minded children and when the \nchance came, introduced us to people from all  over the world, including \na Nigerian who stayed the weekend with us, arriving in the marvelously \nbright Nigerian native clothing.\n\nStill, in school hallways, there were the whispers. That blacks would \nbeat kids up, that you couldn’t trust them.\n\nThis whispering became more apparent in middle school and I think, had \nit not been for my relocation to Ireland, that background whispering \nwould have lodged firmly in my mind.\n\nBut, barring that lingering underlayer of fear, I like to think that the \nfull implant of racism didn’t take with me.  And I think that’s because \nof my time in Ireland… and two people in particular.\n\nIn Ireland my classmates said: “I hate all Yanks!” to which was hastily \nadded, “But not you, I know you.”  Such statements are examples of \nprejudice and bigotry. It was my first experience of prejudice directed \nat me.\n\nThe two people who broke the back of racism for me were strangers.  One \nwas a classmate, the other an actor.\n\nWe’ll take the second first.  He is Lenny Henry — now SirLenny Henry.  \nHe is a black comedian. Hearing a very English accent on a black man \nbroke the mold that society had tried to impose on me about black people \n— that they all spoke the same.  That was a revelation to me, a “Wait, \nwhat?” moment. Not all blacks are the same.  My fourteen year-old \nthinking went like this: “So… this notion that blacks are a threat or \nmenace… that’s a lie!”\n\nMy second revelation came with my classmate, Obudan Obesan. Obudan, for \nme, will always be the primal proof that skin color means \nabsolutelynothing!  Also, he proved that James Joyce was a second-rate \nauthor. I can’t remember when we read Joyce’s The Dubliners.  I’m pretty \nsure it was after I’d first been exposed to Mr. Obesan’s writing.  The \nthing is, Obudan gotthe feel of the Irish, the Dublin Irish, down pat.  \nHe had it better than Joyce. Waayyybetter than Joyce. Nearly fifty years \nlater, my opinion has not changed.\n\nBetween Obudan and Sir Lenny Henry, I threw out that notion that black \npeople were inferior.\n\nWith the benefit of hindsight, I can see how American society has a \nbuilt-in underlying prejudice against people of color.  It starts as the \nwhispers in middle grade and high school corridors: “You can’t trust \nthem.” “They’ll beat you up.” It’s something that we should be aware of, \nshould recognize... and banish.\n\nBecause black culture has imbued our society with somuch. Even while we \nderided it, it gave us rock’n’roll, starting with Chuck Berry. The black \nculture is more vibrant and alive than the old, tired white culture. We \ncan and should learn a lot from it.  The first step is to recognize \nthat. The next step is to embrace this difference, to grasp it and learn \nfrom it. Our society will grow stronger when we do.\n\n*"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["email", "actions", "v1"]}

This is a good thing. \nIt will attract people and favourable situations to you. (We like!) \nHowever, Mercury Retrograde is also in your sign! This is like a magnet \nfor goofy situations. Misplaced items, forgotten appointments, delays, \nlittle frustrations, confused communications, and a general sense of \nfeeling disorganized will create obstacles for you. Because Mars is in \nyour House of Friendships, be careful you don't take your frustrations \nout on a friend. Chill out. Meanwhile, the good news is that Venus will \nattract money to you. It will also encourage you to buy beautiful things \nfor yourself and loved ones. It might even attract new ways to earn \nmoney? Yes!\n\n  Horoscopes by Holiday: Feb. 23, 2020 by Holiday Mathis\n\n*PISCES* (Feb. 19-March 20). Time will reveal the difference between a \nbeneficial and a detrimental distraction. What’s good for one era of \nlife brings little benefit to another era. You’ll intuitively find the \nright thing to chase at the right time.\n\n*TODAY’S BIRTHDAY* (Feb. 23). Funding comes for a project, and soon \nafter you’ll enter a brief period of wonderful solo interior discovery. \nYour focus on unraveling a problem will end in an exciting breakthrough \nand fresh interest. Then you will love – go all-in. And then it’s \nspringtime, your whole heart wide as fields, alive in flowers and \nbuzzing bees. Scorpio and Leo adore you. Your lucky numbers are: 4, 48, \n22, 5 and 39.\n\n*CELEBRITY PROFILES*: It has been announced that Dakota Fanning will \nstar in “The Bell Jar,” an adaptation of the Sylvia Plath novel about a \nyoung woman struggling with mental illness. Fanning was born when the \nsun, Venus and Saturn were all in artistic and empathetic Pisces. Her \nnatal moon is in Leo, the sign of entertainment, and her natal Mercury \nand Mars shine from intellectually and socially savvy Aquarius.\n\nHappy birthday!\n\nLove,\n\nDad"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["email", "summary", "v1"]}

Her mounting anger and vengeance didn't have any \nrational background to support them and her unwillingness to listen to \nreason or learn finally killed any sympathy I might have had for her.\n\nI also questioned the setting -- was this in the 1970s? 80s? 90s? \nEarlier? Later?\n\nGinny's love for her mare didn't work for me. I grew up with horse mad \ngirls, and Ginny didn't fit.  It seemed to me that her horse was at \nabout the same level in her affections as a rusted hand-me-down bicycle.\n\nI began to notice the number of chapters.  There's an *awful* lot of them.\n\nI also wasn't sure about the farm -- was it a cattle farm? Dairy? Crop? \nMixed use?  That question nagged at me and helped pull me out of the book.\n\nCheers,\nTodd McCaffrey\n\nP.S.: The YA/Middle Grade books that I read include:\n\nAlly Carter's /The Gallagher Girls/ \n<https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000S1LF5K>\nalso Ally Carter's Winterborne Home for Vengeance and Valor \n<https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07T4HQR9D>\nAlan Bradley started a marvelous series about an eleven year-old sleuth \nwith The Sweetness at the Bottom of the Pie \n<https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0027G6XDS>\nL.A.

For the most part they are, if you examine the \ndemographics of the majority of readers in the two categories.\n\nBut that does not prevent individual writers from bringing the two \ngenres together and doing incredibly well with it.\n\nSci-Fi Romance was one of the first niche market reports based on our \n\"Virtual Besteller List\" approach that we published back in 2016. In the \nmeantime, the category has grown into a significant market.\n\nTraditional publishers have left money on the table while indie authors \nhave conquered the space (both figuratively and literally).\n\nBoth sci-fi and romance provide escapism to readers during these \nchallenging times. So if you can imagine writing a story about \nintergalactic love, warring species, hunky alien heroes — blue, purple, \nand fiercely protective or possessive of their women — then look no further.\n\nResearch less, write more!

Per my friend's request, I \nneed to do a research about the rental market in your area.\n\nYou have been living at 7861 Dell Ridge for almost two years. The owner \ndidn't rise the rent last year. He is thinking to do it this year, $100.\n\nThere are not a lot of rental properties which similar to yours in that \narea. And the rental price has been going up quite a bit last year. But \nwhen I consider you as a valid tenant, I think $100 increase is kind of \ntoo much. So I have suggested to the owner for $50. After the discussion \nwith his wife, they finally agree the $50 increase.\n\nIf you are okay to accept the offer, I can go ahead to daft up the \naddendum. Thank you for your patience.\n\nBTW - They are not thinking to sell the house in the near future.\n\n----------------\nBest Regards,\nKenneth\n(702) 580-0968\nklee10026@gmail.com <mailto:klee10026@gmail.com>\n\nOn Tue, Apr 28, 2020 at 7:53 PM todd <todd@toddwriter.com \n<mailto:todd@toddwriter.com>> wrote:\n\n    Mr. Lee\n\n    In these trying times we are all facing uncertainty. I would like to\n    know if the owners intention is to re-lease the house, sell it or\n    otherwise. I texted you last week requesting an update on releasing\n    and have not received an answer, which is somewhat disconcerting. It\n    is a very simple question which should not require much deliberation.\n\n    If the owners intention is to sell the home I am interested in\n    discussing that option as well. Given the virus and all the\n    ramifications I really need to know what is happening ASAP please.\n\n    Sincerely,\n\n    Todd McCaffrey"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["email", "actions", "v1"]}

The college launched a television show in August 2020 \ncalled “A World of Difference.” In each episode, “A World of Difference” \nexamines neurodiversity issues related to learning disabilities \nexperienced from birth to adult years, using compelling storytelling, \nconversations with experts, viewer Q&As and interviews with successful \nindividuals with learning differences of their own. In just eight \nmonths’ time, the program has garnered a raft of honors including from \nthe Education Digital Marketing Awards and PR News’ CSR Diversity Awards \nand has expanded (and continues to grow) its reach to 11 channels in \neight states through regional, public, educational and governmental \n(PEG) stations. “A World of Difference” is available throughout the \nUnited States via public access TV channels, and is available globally \nvia the college’s Facebook and YouTube channels. You can watch our most \nrecent episode here: https://youtu.be/zmO9ef5iKxw One of the segments of \nwhich we’re most proud is “Difference Makers.” The feature salutes \nsomeone famous and/or successful who has a learning difference, or \nsomeone is a successful advocate for individuals with learning \ndisabilities. We are interested in presenting The Winner Twins with our \n“Difference Maker” Award (https://beaconcollege.egnyte.com/dl/EsGCgOGdCL \nfor their exceptional contributions to literature and their \ndetermination to succeed while living with learning differences, and the \nfounding of Motivate2Learn. “A World of Difference” airs on WACX Orlando \nSuperchannel 55 (which is available in 1 million Florida cable homes). \nIt’s produced by a multiple-Telly Award and Emmy-nominated production \ncompany, NG Production Films. The show also is more widely available on \nour Facebook Watch and YouTube channels and the show’s website, \nhttps://www.AWODTV.org. More exciting, later this month we sign a \ncontract to put the program into the PBS pipeline, airing soon on WUCF \nOrlando. Previous “Difference Makers” have included: • Dr. Temple \nGrandin • Retired U.S. Sen. Tom Harkin (the architect of the Americans \nwith Disabilities Act) • Stanley Cup champion hockey player Brent Sopel \n• Shark Tank’s Daymond John You can view “Difference Maker” segments \nhere: https://awodtv.org/category/difference-maker/ All that would be \nrequired of the Winner twins is for them to sit for an interview, either \nvirtually or in-person (their choice), so we can create the segment.

We're worried about the delta variant, \nparticularly because Brit's doctor has told her specifically NOT to get \nthe vaccine -- it might make things much worse for her.\n\nAs it is, Brit will be heading back to LA to see an eye doctor at UCLA \nbecause in the past several weeks she's noticed two very troubling \nthings: her hearing has gotten worse and her eyesight has gotten worse.  \nA good retinal doctor here in Vegas detected signs of thinning in the \noptic nerve.  Not good.  Brit took the news in stride.  She's hoping \nthat it's Usher's Type 3 because then she'll have a diagnosis.  It also \nhelps that the eye doctor in UCLA has seen her before, willingly calls \n*her* and is also the guy who originally determined the existence of \nUsher's Type 3. Anyway, we cross fingers.  In the meantime, Brit has got \nhearing aids and loves being able to hear things she didn't notice for \nthe past five years -- like being able to hear her nails tapping on things.\n\nI am busy writing a sequel to a novel I just completed.  The first \nnovel, RAW SPACE, is out with alpha readers.  You know, nothing out of \nthe ordinary, just a space opera where someone has planted zombie sex \nbugs on the Fleet's laundry ship ;)\n\nI hope you're doing well.\n\nLove,\n\nTodd"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["email", "summary", "v1"]}

Hope this email finds you well, it's been awhile, and \nI pray we all get to meet up at conventions again. <sigh>\n\nIn the meantime, please forgive my shameless promotion here. I'm gunning \nfor recommendations for my last History channel videogame, /Project Blue \nBook/ with little or no guidance and have drummed up this post on the \nSFWA board. For amplification purposes I am sending it out to certain \nSFWA members who may be interested in playing and/or reading the game's \nscript for consideration. Hope you won't mind being on my list. Did you \nhappen to catch the TV series? Well worth watching.\n\nHere is an overview of *Project Blue Book: The Game* with the attached \ngame script for your consideration (as well as some smaller samples) and \nlinks to play the game for free. Enjoy!\n\nThe information below has been posted in its entirety on the Members \nOnly SFWA message boards at the following link, and should be treated \nconfidentially: \nhttps://www.sfwa.org/forum/topic/15951-project-blue-book-the-game-by-steven-elliot-altman-and-julie-marsh/ \n<https://www.sfwa.org/forum/topic/15951-project-blue-book-the-game-by-steven-elliot-altman-and-julie-marsh/>\n\nProject Blue Book The Game Image 2.png\n\nProject Blue Book: The Game by Steven-Elliot Altman and Julie Marsh\n\nPlease find attached the Final Production Draft of Project Blue Book: \nThe Game, which I wrote for A&E Networks based on their History Channel \nseries, along with my clue writer Julie Marsh (Julie was not credited on \nthe game itself, as I was featured, but I am compelled to include her \nfor consideration due to her essential contributions).\n\nI was attempting to bring the genres of television writing and videogame \nwriting one step closer. I was given nearly free reign by the network \nand showrunners on how to proceed, and so decided to write my own \nadaptations of half the game's cases based on produced episodes of the \nTV series (with additional scenes that I envisioned) and the other half \nof the cases as original cases which I based on actual declassified \nU.S.A.F Project Blue Book files.\n\nThe Production Draft encompasses all 9 Cases of Season One of the game. \nBecause this document is quite lengthy I have also attached \"Case 105: \nThe Aztec Recovery\" (in which I introduce J. Robert Oppenheimer to the \ngame's story) and \"Case 107: Project Rainbow\" (in which I \nintroduce Albert Einstein to the game's story, in a story previously \ndramatized as the feature film /The Philadelphia Experiment/) as two \nsmaller samples of the complete work.\n\nBesides the script, the game is FREE TO PLAY as a mobile app available \nfor both IOS and Android phones and tablets in the safe links listed \nbelow, and I invite you to play!\n\nProject Blue Book: The Game on IOS \n<https://apps.apple.com/us/app/project-blue-book-the-game/id1445162277>\n\nProject Blue Book: The Game on Android \n<https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.threegates.projectbluebook&hl=en_US>\n\nAnd for anyone who does not wish to actually play the game, here are \ntwo youtube videos posted by players that depict the game's opening \ntutorial, and the start of CASE 101, The Fuller Dogfight.\n\nProject Blue Book Opening Cut Scene and Tutorial \n<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFhBUpUeqsE&t=5s>\n\nProject Blue Book Case 101 Walkthrough \n<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOhAgdjG7bY&t=23s>\n\nAnd finally, here is the approved description from the app store:\n\nProject Blue Book: The Game is the official, free-to-play, hidden object \nadventure game based on HISTORY’s hit drama series PROJECT BLUE BOOK, \ncreated by David O'Leary, and executive produced by Academy Award and \nGolden Globe® winner Robert Zemeckis. The series explores the \nhistorical, Top Secret investigations into UFOs conducted by the U.S. \nAir Force between 1952 and 1969.\n\nIn Project Blue Book: The Game, you will start off as a newly recruited \nagent in Project Blue Book during the 1950s, under the guidance of the \nshow's lead investigators, Dr. J. Allen Hynek (played by Aidan Gillen \nfrom “Game Of Thrones”), and Captain Michael Quinn (played by Michael \nMalarkey from “The Vampire Diaries”), and begin to investigate real \ndeclassified UFO investigations to find the truth!\n\nHundreds of puzzles, witness interviews and hidden object scenes will \nchallenge your observation and deduction tactics as you investigate \nalongside your favorite characters into many of the cases you loved from \nthe series, uncover exclusive new content, and explore new cases that \ncan only be found in the game! The game's story is written by \nbestselling science-fiction writer and award-winning game writer \nSteven-Elliot Altman, best known for similar social games like PEARL’S \nPERIL and ANCIENT ALIENS.\n\nWe're here to find the truth! So, come help us investigate flying \nsaucers along with Dr. Hynek in the world's first Unidentified Flying \n(Hidden) Object Game!\n\nThank you for considering *Project Blue Book: The Game* for a Nebula \nNomination in the best game writing category.

I'm sure you've already addressed this even though it doesn't \nshow up in the version I downloaded.  Just throwing this out there since \nI did observe it.\n\n*Chapter12*\nLocation 4956 - typo... her, not his .../Margaret replied cheerfully, \nbounding out of /her /seat./\n\nLocation 5107 - awkward sentence, not sure if you meant to say ./..relay \na stream of conscious report of an SC that *is* thinking very loudly/ or \npossibly /...relay a stream of conscious report of an SC that *thinks* \nvery loudly /or /if it's ...conscious report *to* an SC.../\n\nLocation 5147 - typo... I, not If  (*I* believe that it will be more \nmeaningful...)\n\nLocation 5188 - typo... insert \"would\" (But what *would* you do in my \nposition?)\n\nLocation 5217 - typo... Clio, not Cio\n\nLocation 5243 - not sure that *nearly* fits here unless it is supposed \nto be *just*. Maybe omit it completely? (...looked to Owami for \nconfirmation, but Owami nearly waved her back to Cona).\n\nLocation 5347 - typo... on, not off (...co-pilot's hands so that they \nwere centered *on* the self-destruct button...)\n\nLocation 5425 - \"Admirals Branford\" isn't correct. Janis is not a \nBranford, but he is an Admiral.\n\n*Chapter 13*\nLocation 5572 - when onboard the ships, the British word lift is used.  \nActually, I think it works fine.  Just pointing out the use of British \nEnglish.\n\nLocation 5588 -  May not be anything but... /You've been requested to go \nTDY to the NWC for the next week./ Not quite sure what this means. Is \nTDY Training Duty?  If so, my mind would read it better as /You've been \nrequested to *do* TDY *at* the NWC for the next week./  Maybe this is \nhow they speak and my non-military mind just has problems.\n\nLocation 5739 - Comma needed for If/then sentence: /Because if she were \npicked*,***it'd mean that.../\n\nLocation 5817 - typo... planted, not planet (...and by whom that \nbacterial assault was *planted* on Sparkle)\n\nLocation 5858 - typo... Rochelle, not Rachel\n\nLocation 5935 - Insert \"said\"... Fromer *said* as he strolled...\n\n*Chapter 14*\nLocation 5962: typo... The, not They (*The* four of them fit..)\n\n*Chapter 15*\nLocation 6488: tonnes - is it British for tons? (...there's /tonnes/ \nwe're not seeing). I may have seen this somewhere else, but not sure if \nit was in this book or the first one, /Raw Space/.\n\nLocation 6724 - is this a typo... she, not he or is there someone else \nOwami is referring to? (She didn't want to joggle the Major's arm while \n*she* was conducing the assault...)\n\nLocation 6744 - typo... her, not him (Cona sent in *her* first team...)\n\nLocation 6772 - typo... her, not his (/Clip/, Cona ordered and *her* \nreserve squad moved out...)\n\nLocation 6824 - typo... outsider should be plural (... the name used \nwith *outsiders* for /The King's Own Ghosts...)/\n\n*Chapter 16*\nLocation 6966 (2nd paragraph of chapter) - This is a very long sentence. \nSuggestions: 1) move the comma from before to after \"Scotty\" and 2)  \ndrop the \"when\" along with the comma and put a period after Munchkin\n\nLocation 7032 - typo... on, not own (\"So put her *on* alert,\" Rochelle \nsaid.)\n\nLocation 7088 - same confusing working for me: ...cadets were with us \nTDY to the NWC...  Guess it's just me.\n\nLocation 7159 - typo... Morton has a \"w\" on the end\n\n*Chapter 17*\nLocation 7227 - typo whether, not when (... hard pressed to say \n*whether* her bedmate was male, female, or something else.)\n\nLocation 7244 - The math doesn't work. If Neff's sun is 700,000 times \nlarger than Canaris Prime, it would be 14 million km in diameter, not \n1.4 km.  For 1.4 million km diameter, it would only be 70,000 times \nlarger. (FYI - I did not check the mass calculations.)\n\nLocation 7279 - 1) typo... *Ophelia* is not possessive and 2) delete \n\"said even\" (...kneeling down to Ophelia's said even as she hit...)\n\nThat's all I have for you Todd.  Hope I didn't get this to you too late.\nSusan"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["email", "intent", "v1"]}

McCaffrey:\n\nYou are receiving this email because the AmazonSmile charity you are \nsupporting, Motivate 2 Learn (EIN: 27-0664968), has not provided \nAmazonSmile with its bank account information and therefore we have been \nunable to issue AmazonSmile donations to this organization. We have also \nreached out to Motivate 2 Learn (EIN: 27-0664968) to request \nregistration completion to enable receipt of donations.\n\nSince we have not successfully been able to issue the donations based on \nyour previous AmazonSmile purchases, we have been holding these \ndonations. You have until 02/22/20 to select a different charity to \nsupport and Amazon will issue the donation amount generated as a result \nof your previous purchases to the new charity you select. If you do not \nselect a different charitable organization to support by 02/22/20 we \nwill reallocate the donation amount proportionately to other \nfully-registered AmazonSmile charities in the next quarterly donation \ndisbursement cycle.\n\nRemember, Amazon donates 0.5% of the purchase price of eligible items \npurchased at smile.amazon.com \n<https://www.amazon.com/gp/f.html?C=19NA8SQ79PZIM&K=824R9N5NCP1B&M=urn:rtn:msg:202003050647126ac73f838cfa479bacc5276aac40p0na&R=1M37VRPVFPMXE&T=C&U=https%3A%2F%2Fsmile.amazon.com%2F%3Fref_%3Dpe_2466700_168532830&H=OAH0A1JTPASWSOEJWUSDCY1AK8IA&ref_=pe_2466700_168532830>. \nFor more information on the program, go to smile.amazon.com/about \n<https://www.amazon.com/gp/f.html?C=19NA8SQ79PZIM&K=824R9N5NCP1B&M=urn:rtn:msg:202003050647126ac73f838cfa479bacc5276aac40p0na&R=22MUV4G1596X3&T=C&U=https%3A%2F%2Fsmile.amazon.com%2Fap%2Fsignin%3F_encoding%3DUTF8%26openid.assoc_handle%3Dusflex%26openid.claimed_id%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fspecs.openid.net%252Fauth%252F2.0%252Fidentifier_select%26openid.identity%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fspecs.openid.net%252Fauth%252F2.0%252Fidentifier_select%26openid.mode%3Dlogout%26openid.ns%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fspecs.openid.net%252Fauth%252F2.0%26openid.ns.pape%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fspecs.openid.net%252Fextensions%252Fpape%252F1.0%26openid.pape.max_auth_age%3D0%26openid.return_to%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fsmile.amazon.com%252Fgp%252Fchpf%252Fabout%252Fref%253Dsmi_em_rev_ft_abt%253F_encoding%253DUTF8%2526*Version*%253D1%2526*entries*%253D0%26pageId%3Dsmile_gen%26ref_%3Dpe_2466700_168532830&H=TBS7ZYQ4QXBLADQQXABNLOTGNQWA&ref_=pe_2466700_168532830>. \n\nChoose a new charity \n<https://www.amazon.com/gp/f.html?C=19NA8SQ79PZIM&K=824R9N5NCP1B&M=urn:rtn:msg:202003050647126ac73f838cfa479bacc5276aac40p0na&R=3TYUL6W9QC3QP&T=C&U=https%3A%2F%2Fsmile.amazon.com%2Fref%3Dpe_2466700_168532830_Optional%5Bsmi_em_sta_bnew_2%5D&H=J8JLR8M1AQCICSGFEZCCHGHT9OAA&ref_=pe_2466700_168532830_Optional> \n\nPlease see smile.amazon.com/about \n<https://www.amazon.com/gp/f.html?C=19NA8SQ79PZIM&K=824R9N5NCP1B&M=urn:rtn:msg:202003050647126ac73f838cfa479bacc5276aac40p0na&R=1DBG53JIGRLGJ&T=C&U=https%3A%2F%2Fsmile.amazon.com%2Fap%2Fsignin%3F_encoding%3DUTF8%26openid.assoc_handle%3Dusflex%26openid.claimed_id%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fspecs.openid.net%252Fauth%252F2.0%252Fidentifier_select%26openid.identity%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fspecs.openid.net%252Fauth%252F2.0%252Fidentifier_select%26openid.mode%3Dlogout%26openid.ns%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fspecs.openid.net%252Fauth%252F2.0%26openid.ns.pape%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fspecs.openid.net%252Fextensions%252Fpape%252F1.0%26openid.pape.max_auth_age%3D0%26openid.return_to%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fsmile.amazon.com%252Fgp%252Fchpf%252Fabout%252Fref%253Dsmi_em_rev_ft_abt%253F_encoding%253DUTF8%2526*Version*%253D1%2526*entries*%253D0%26pageId%3Dsmile_gen%26ref_%3Dpe_2466700_168532830&H=OKHVFMU5K99MTIXCV8L3LUWJHKMA&ref_=pe_2466700_168532830> \nfor AmazonSmile program details.\n\n© 2020 Amazon.com, Inc. or its affiliates.

We first met at a WotF workshop in \nHollywood in 2015 (I think). At the time I was teaching high school \nphysics and English (SF/Fantasy Literature) at an all boys Catholic \nschool in San Diego. I was mesmerized by the story of your development \nfrom \"reluctant readers\" to bestselling authors. Very inspirational for \na teacher! At Comic-Con in 2017, I attended your panel and visited your \nbooth on the Exhibit Hall Floor, where you graciously gifted me with \nyour World Building guide (although that may have come from the \nworkshop; I don't really remember) and an autographed copy of \"The \nStrand Prophecy.\" For reasons I won't go into here, I will tell you that \nthe book sat on my shelf for almost a year before I finally read it, and \nthat the 2017 Comic-Con was the last one I attended--until this year. I \nwas so happy to have gotten tickets for this year's Con, and so \ndisappointed when it was cancelled. But here we are at Comic-Con at \nHome, and I am able finally to tell you both that I finally did read \n\"The Strand Prophecy,\" and I really enjoyed it! My life circumstances \nhave changed rather significantly since last we met, and I see that \nyours have as well. Brittany, I was shocked and sorry to hear about your \nvision loss, but I'm happy to hear you're still going strong. I now no \nlonger teach high school physics and English to boys, but middle school \nscience and literature to both boys and girls at a Catholic K-12 school \nin Indiana. VERY different climate from SoCal, and not just in terms of \nthe weather! I was looking through your products offered on the \nComic-Con at Home Exhibitor Hall website, and I had a couple of \nquestions that I hope you can answer before I start purchasing (and \nthank you in advance for your time): 1. How many total volumes are there \nin the Twin Soul series, and how many of these are compiled in the \nOmnibus? Is this a series that would be appropriate for middle school \nstudents from conservative Catholic families? 2. Is Millennial Madness \nan autobiography, or is it a fictionalized story? I'd love to be able to \nshare your ladies' story with my own students, IN YOUR WORDS. It's nice \nto be in touch with you again. I love your work! Looking forward to \nhearing back from you soon--hopefully before the Con ends and before you \nrun out of merchandise! :) Be well! May God bless you both! Sincerely, \nBob Weber P.S.

Her mounting anger and vengeance didn't have any \nrational background to support them and her unwillingness to listen to \nreason or learn finally killed any sympathy I might have had for her.\n\nI also questioned the setting -- was this in the 1970s? 80s? 90s? \nEarlier? Later?\n\nGinny's love for her mare didn't work for me. I grew up with horse mad \ngirls, and Ginny didn't fit.  It seemed to me that her horse was at \nabout the same level in her affections as a rusted hand-me-down bicycle.\n\nI began to notice the number of chapters.  There's an *awful* lot of them.\n\nI also wasn't sure about the farm -- was it a cattle farm? Dairy? Crop? \nMixed use?  That question nagged at me and helped pull me out of the book.\n\nCheers,\nTodd McCaffrey\n\nP.S.: The YA/Middle Grade books that I read include:\n\nAlly Carter's /The Gallagher Girls/ \n<https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000S1LF5K>\nalso Ally Carter's Winterborne Home for Vengeance and Valor \n<https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07T4HQR9D>\nAlan Bradley started a marvelous series about an eleven year-old sleuth \nwith The Sweetness at the Bottom of the Pie \n<https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0027G6XDS>\nL.A. Meyer produced the amazing Bloody Jack \n<https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003K16PPU> series.\nAlso, Carlos Hernandez knocked it out of the park with Sal and Gabi \nBreak the Universe <https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FL82MKG> which is \ncurrently an Amazon #1 Best Seller"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["email", "draft_or_rewrite", "v1"]}

The \nthen-named Todd Johnson came into the world as a rather precocious \nmiddle child. Anyone who questions the precocious part has only to read \nsome of the anecdotes in “Dragonholder” to have any doubt removed. He \nspent most of his childhood on the East Coast of the USA until moving to \nDublin, Ireland with his mother and sister in 1970.\n\nLike most of the boys growing up in the ’60s, McCaffrey became space \nmad. However, unlike most of the other young men running around their \nyards in pretend helmets and throwing toy rockets into the air, he was \ngiven a “complete” set of the actual Lunar Module Pilot Study Guides in \n1968. The number of hours spent devouring them repeatedly from cover to \ncover is evident in the fact that he has been known to quote excerpts \nfrom them during convention panels.\n\nWhen the time came for him to pursue higher education, McCaffrey \nattended Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, for a year—and \nhated it. But he did discover one of the great loves of his life while \nhe was there, computers. He graduated with Honors—or rather, \n“Honours”—in 1985 from Trinity College, Dublin.\n\nHaving never lost his love for space, he left Ireland for Los Angeles, \nCalifornia, in the hopes of working in the aerospace industry. However, \nthe computers got him first, and he began working in computer \nprogramming in 1986. He continued to develop his love of space and all \nmechanical things that fly by getting a private pilot’s license in 1988. \nOne interesting side note is the collapse of the aerospace industry in 1989.\n\nDuring this time, his interest in writing also took flight. The sale of \nsome of his early short stories helped him log an impressive amount of \nairtime. He flew across the continent solo in 1989, attending Oshkosh \nalong the way. After quitting his day job in 1990 to write full time, he \nrepeated his solo cross-continent flight and attended the 1990 Oshkosh \nas well.\n\nTodd McCaffrey became a Writers of the Future judge in 2011.\n\n    /“///The Writers of the Future is one of the premier awards that’s\n    available particularly to new writers. It’s basically the only one\n    there. This is a chance to open up the universe to reward people who\n    are trying and striving and succeeding in creating great stories, to\n    reward them with more than just a pat on the back to actually some\n    monetary reward and some recognition and to give them a leg up into\n    the world of a professional writer.///” /—Todd McCaffrey\n\nFind out more at: pernhome.com/tjm/ <http://pernhome.com/tjm/>"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["email", "draft_or_rewrite", "v1"]}

The dialog, the pacing… \neverything in that movie just works. They not only handle the hero well, \nthey handle the supporting characters well.\n\nIt used to be that you could go to Drew’s Script-o-rama \n<http://www.script-o-rama.com/>and read the screenplay (probably final \ncut). And that screenplay reads. Just reading it to yourself, on your \nown, and you get the pacing, the pull, the feel of the story. Good stuff.\n\nSo when the question comes, is it a holiday crime story, the answer \nseems obvious. It’s certainly a crime story -- bad guys want to steal \nhundreds of millions of bearer bonds and don’t care who (or how many) \nthey kill to get them. And it does occur sometime in the Christmas \nholiday frame, probably one to two weeks beforehand (that’s the normal \ntime for corporate office parties).\n\nBUT… the test of a holiday story is whether you can take the story out \nof the holiday period and have it still work.\n\nWith that in mind, I considered other films that would be regarded as \nholiday films and how they worked.\n\nConsider The Santa Clause (not a crime story), Elf(also not a crime \nstory), and Home Alone(a crime story).\n\nIn the case of The Santa Clausethe whole premise is that our hero finds \nhimself becomingSanta Claus. He transforms from a curmudgeon along the \nway into a person of character and soul. Can you move this story out of \nthe Xmas holiday? Nope, no way. The story doesn’t exist without \nChristmas, specifically without the whole Santa Claus mythos. Elfis \nsimilarly constrained: no story without Christmas (and, in fact, our Elf \nsaves Christmas).\n\nWith Home Alone, the question becomes more involved. Our young hero is \naccidentally left behind and finds himself defending his home against \nwould-be robbers. The basic plot -- young hero left alone to fight \nagainst bad guys -- is not dependent on the holidays per se.  We could \nhave placed this in the summer or spring break or a number of other \nholidays -- or even just played it out withouta holiday (albeit with \nperhaps more difficulty). But the robbers rely on automatic light \nsystems and lots of empty houses to target. That spells holidays, and \npretty much spells Xmas. Also, our hero has a bonding moment with Scary \nShovel Guy which helps affirm his course of action and speaks to general \nhuman kindness. So… this would be difficult to make work without the \nXmas holiday. In this regard, I’d consider this to be a Holiday (Xmas) \nCrime story.\n\nWhen pondering Die Hardand the question of whether it is a Holiday Crime \nstory, I asked myself firstly: Could I change the holiday? If I could, \nthen perhaps the “Holiday” part of the “holiday crime” story was \nsuperfluous.\n\nWhat if this was a New Year’s Eve story?  Consider inter-cutting between \nthe New Year’s Ball falling in Times Square and Hans Gruber falling to \nhis death.  Consider, instead of “Now I’ve got a machine gun! Ho-ho-ho!” \nhaving “Thanks for the party favor, now I can really make noise when the \nball drops!”  And more.  I’d say that Die Hardcould easily be moved to \nbe a New Year story.  In fact, that adds even more to the fundamental \nplot line -- because New Year’s marks new beginnings and the central \npersonal question of the movie is “Will John McClane lose his wife and \nfamily?”  That could now morph into the side question, “What will the \nNew Year hold for John McClane?”\n\n[Also, let’s not forget that we’re talking about a Hollywood movie.  \nThey have to be pretty flexible in their details because no one can be \ncertain when someone demands a change of location or timing.]\n\nWith this, then, the question becomes: Does this movie haveto be a \nholiday movie (let alone a Christmas movie).  Why can’t it be set in the \nsummer?  The essentials -- a new building, corporate party (“great \nquarter”) do not demand a holiday, that could happen any time. The \nrobbery could happen any time. In fact, the holidays are possibly a \nbadtime for a heist (note, for example, that noneof the Ocean’s movies \nused a holiday), in that such times often come with increased delays and \nheightened security.\n\nSo, if we take the holiday out of this movie, does it fall apart? No. \nThe fundamental story is not dependent on the time of year, season, or \nholidays. Therefore, this is NOT a HolidayCrime Story.\n\nHence my, “Well… damn.”\n\n*"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["email", "fields", "v1"]}

Feel free to share with Eliza. I'll write more as I get the \ntime. (I'm still REALLY sad about Chadwick Boseman - his is a great loss.)\n\nWe grew up in several locations in the US, all in the northeast:\n\n 1.\n\n    Montclair, NJ.  I left when I was two and have no memories.\n\n 2.\n\n    100 Danforth Place, Windybush, Wilmington, Delaware\n\n     1.\n\n        With one interruption, we lived there from the time I was 2\n        (1958) until we moved to 369 Carpenter Ave., Sea Cliff, Long\n        Island, NY in 1965\n\n 3.\n\n    369 Carpenter Avenue, Sea Cliff, Long Island, New York\n\n     1.\n\n        We lived there from 1965 until we (Gigi, Mum, and I) moved to\n        Ireland in 1970\n\n 4.\n\n    In Ireland (just to continue the record), we first lived in:\n\n     1.\n\n          14 North Avenue, Mount Merrion (1970-71)\n\n     2.\n\n        Meadowbrook House, Dundrum (1971-72)\n\n         1.\n\n            Alec joined us there and became a trawler fisherman.\n\n     3.\n\n        Site 11 Rochestown Avenue (1972-73)\n\n         1.\n\n            Alec wasn’t here\n\n     4.\n\n        79 Shanganagh Vale, Cabinteely (1973-1979?)\n\n         1.\n\n            Nor was Alec here.\n\n     5.\n\n        Dragonhold, Kilquade, Co. Wicklow (1979-1987)\n\n         1.\n\n            He visited here occasionally\n\n     6.\n\n         From there, Mum moved into Dragonhold-Underhill and lived there\n        until she died in 2011.\n\nI have many memories of Alec, some of which are great and some of which \nare not.\n\nWhen we were in 100 Danforth, we all got kittens: Tasso (Alec), Tallabar \n(me), and Silkie Blackington (for Gigi with much adult supervision in \nthe naming else the cat would have been simply “Blackie”).\n\nTasso was a tortoise shell.  He lost an argument with a car not long \nafter we got him. Alec was devastated.\n\nTallabar was a multi-color, a mix of grays and oranges.  Quite the \npretty cat.\n\nSilkie was your average black cat.  She was sweet and her fur was very \nsoft, hence the name.\n\nSilkie and Tallabar went on to have many, many litters.  Tallabar was \ngood at producing orange marmalade cats.\n\nWe also had dogs, starting with Wizard (a German Shepherd) followed by \nhis son, Merlin.  Wiz decided that I was his human charge. We had a \nsloping hill outside our front door and it went down to join the street \nwhich formed part of the branches of a tee-junction (the other street \ntee’d into Danforth Place).  Wiz decided that I was not allowed to go \ndown that hill when I was an infant and took to blocking me.\n\nOur next door neighbors (to our left as you’re standing in the front \ndoor looking out) were the Estes.  Larry Estes was Alec’s age.  I think \ntheir daughter was close to Gigi’s age.  Alec and Larry hung out and I \ndid my best to tag along, often successfully.\n\nThere was another housing estate being built across the railroad tracks \nbeyond a small woods at the edge of Windybush and we used to trek there \nmany a  time. The woods had some pretty decent undergrowth. One day \nLarry got a hold of his father’s machete (from WWII) and he and Alec \ntook turns “clearing” the underbrush (think Indiana Jones in South \nAmerica at the beginning of Raiders of the Lost Ark).  I must have been \naround six.  At one point Alec told me to stand back.  I did but, \napparently, not far enough and the machete tore into my shin.  I think \nit was Alec who carried me back to the house. I went to the ER and got \nfour stitches.\n\nAnother  time, when I was eight or so, we had a particularly hard but \ndry winter.  It was decided to go exploring (“mountain climbing”?) in \nthe culverts at the upper side of the estate.  Alec had brought a hammer \nalong to poke holes in the ice as handholds.  He told me (seems to be a \npattern here) to get back and swung immediately after I said, “Okay” but \nbefore I could comply (well, that’s my story) and I got the claws of the \nhammer hitting my head -- just on the eye socket.  A bit lower and I \nwould have lost the eye.  As it was, I got two stitches without novocaine.\n\nAh, the good years!\n\nAlec and I fought often enough that I have many recollections of \nvariously being forced to eat grass or dirt to escape being buried under \nhim.\n\nIn 1962 we moved to Dusseldorf, Germany for six months because Dad had a \njob doing PR work for DuPont that required him to work there.  Overall, \nit was a marvelous experience.  Alec, Gigi, and I were all very \nnordic-looking and, when we didn’t speak, had no trouble passing for \nGerman (Dad’s family had roots in Schleswig-Holstein on the \nGerman-Danish border).  Mum place Alec and I in the local German \nschool.  I can’t say how well Alec did but I flourished, having a \nteacher who could speak English (she was raised in England during the \nwar) and I learned excellent “gekauft Deutsch” -- as Mum called it \n(“shopping German”).\n\nWe all adored the chocolate over there.  We took the tram everywhere, \nun-parented.  I recall once having some old Frau look at us and scoff, \n“Ach, Englander!” to which I replied, “Nein, Amerikaner!” -- that seemed \nto both affront and appease her, somewhat (the English had ruled the \narea after the war and weren’t particularly good at it).\n\nThey had these marvelous parades where they’d throw candy.  We all loved \nthat.\n\nWe got a VW station wagon while we were over there and, when our time \nwas up, drove around Europe (France, Germany, Holland, at least).  We \ntook the ferry to England.  We were broke, so we camped one night all in \nthe VW and discovered later the next day that we’d stopped outside an \ninsane asylum.  We dropped the car off for transport to the States and \nheaded to Gatwick airport (Heathrow was not then built), only to \ndiscover that there was some tax that we still had to pay before we \ncould board the flight back.  This caused the parents immense distress \nuntil a nice American couple, hearing the panic, loaned us the money \n(there were Texans).\n\n*"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["email", "fields", "v1"]}

I'm taking one \non Photoshop and, despite years of experience, I am learning things \nabout Photoshop that I didn't know.  I've signed up for the Advanced \nPhotoshop course by the same instructor, as well as a nice class on \ncover design by a German woman who speaks passable English.\n\nThe twins -- my writing partners -- are both still alive which, given \nwhat's been going on with Brit (the alpha of the two) and her health is \nactually saying quite a lot.  We think the root problem for her is some \nsort of auto-immune disease but we haven't got it down to specifics. Her \nhemiplegic migraines are nearly synonymous with strokes (sigh).  She's a \ntough lady but these past four years have been physically exhausting for \nher.  What seems to be helping most now is an acupuncturist who is using \nherbals to calm her nerves (literally, nice big needles go to nerve nexi).\n\nI'm thinking that \"this too shall pass\" and we'll see the end of the \nCOVID tunnel but perhaps not fully until 2022 (sigh).  Our ancestors \nsurvived much worse... although that's scant comfort.\n\nOne thing I have grown to realize is how incredibly powerful an \nindividual human being is.  Take Greta Thunberg as an example. In fact, \ntake anyone who decides that they will change things (Rosa Parks, the \nstudents in Tienanmen Square).  I wonder why we fail to use our strength \nso often?  Is it because changing the world is pretty consuming passion \nand we choose to avoid it?\n\nI also am in shock that too many of my fellow countrymen (and women) are \nwilling to accept a con man for President and cede unto him all the \npowers of a dictator.  I really have a hard time adjusting to how *dumb* \nthese people are.  It makes me very sad.\n\nI recall reading an article not too long ago praising some young black \nkids for their genius IQs. It wasn't the color of their skin that \nintrigued me -- it was that one of the kids scored a 142 on the \nStanford-Binet IQ test.  I scored a 156 at the same age.  That made it \nreally strike home that I am genius (gush, shucks, folks!).  I have \nalways held the belief that everyone on this planet is as empowered as I \nam; that given the right set of circumstances, they could accomplish \nwhatever they set their minds to, that we were universal in our \npotential.  Now, with the whole mess of the last four years, I have to \nquestion that and that has been causing me a great deal of angst.\n\nTelevision-wise, I am now particularly spoiled.  I acquired a marvelous \nASUS 34\" ProArt curved monitor which now graces my desk in my bedroom.  \nOver the holidays I acquired a Amazon Roku Firestick and discovered that \nI can pipe TV signals through my HDMI2 port.  So I've been getting 4k TV \nfrom 18 inches. Whew!\n\nI've been watching the new Star Trek Discovery.  The first season nearly \nkilled it for me because every episode pretty much stopped dead when the \nKlingons came on.  Season Two was better and now Season Three is quite \nenjoyable (forgiving such complete inanity as \"parasitic ice\").\n\nI watched the Mandolorian with a skeptical eye particularly as so much \nof it was just pure re-cast western. And there was one episode that \nstopped me for weeks but I was assured that things got better.\n\nI've also been re-watching Dr. Who, starting with Eccleston who was such \na marvelous Doctor.  I'm sorry he couldn't stick around longer (but \nmaybe he would have gone stale).\n\nAnyway, that's a taste of life at Dell Ridge.\n\nAlways glad to hear from you, my oldest friend!\n\nLove,\n\nTodd"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["email", "actions", "v1"]}

I'm taking one \non Photoshop and, despite years of experience, I am learning things \nabout Photoshop that I didn't know.  I've signed up for the Advanced \nPhotoshop course by the same instructor, as well as a nice class on \ncover design by a German woman who speaks passable English.\n\nThe twins -- my writing partners -- are both still alive which, given \nwhat's been going on with Brit (the alpha of the two) and her health is \nactually saying quite a lot.  We think the root problem for her is some \nsort of auto-immune disease but we haven't got it down to specifics. Her \nhemiplegic migraines are nearly synonymous with strokes (sigh).  She's a \ntough lady but these past four years have been physically exhausting for \nher.  What seems to be helping most now is an acupuncturist who is using \nherbals to calm her nerves (literally, nice big needles go to nerve nexi).\n\nI'm thinking that \"this too shall pass\" and we'll see the end of the \nCOVID tunnel but perhaps not fully until 2022 (sigh).  Our ancestors \nsurvived much worse... although that's scant comfort.\n\nOne thing I have grown to realize is how incredibly powerful an \nindividual human being is.  Take Greta Thunberg as an example. In fact, \ntake anyone who decides that they will change things (Rosa Parks, the \nstudents in Tienanmen Square).  I wonder why we fail to use our strength \nso often?  Is it because changing the world is pretty consuming passion \nand we choose to avoid it?\n\nI also am in shock that too many of my fellow countrymen (and women) are \nwilling to accept a con man for President and cede unto him all the \npowers of a dictator.  I really have a hard time adjusting to how *dumb* \nthese people are.  It makes me very sad.\n\nI recall reading an article not too long ago praising some young black \nkids for their genius IQs. It wasn't the color of their skin that \nintrigued me -- it was that one of the kids scored a 142 on the \nStanford-Binet IQ test.  I scored a 156 at the same age.  That made it \nreally strike home that I am genius (gush, shucks, folks!).  I have \nalways held the belief that everyone on this planet is as empowered as I \nam; that given the right set of circumstances, they could accomplish \nwhatever they set their minds to, that we were universal in our \npotential.  Now, with the whole mess of the last four years, I have to \nquestion that and that has been causing me a great deal of angst.\n\nTelevision-wise, I am now particularly spoiled.  I acquired a marvelous \nASUS 34\" ProArt curved monitor which now graces my desk in my bedroom.  \nOver the holidays I acquired a Amazon Roku Firestick and discovered that \nI can pipe TV signals through my HDMI2 port.  So I've been getting 4k TV \nfrom 18 inches. Whew!\n\nI've been watching the new Star Trek Discovery.  The first season nearly \nkilled it for me because every episode pretty much stopped dead when the \nKlingons came on.  Season Two was better and now Season Three is quite \nenjoyable (forgiving such complete inanity as \"parasitic ice\").\n\nI watched the Mandolorian with a skeptical eye particularly as so much \nof it was just pure re-cast western. And there was one episode that \nstopped me for weeks but I was assured that things got better.\n\nI've also been re-watching Dr. Who, starting with Eccleston who was such \na marvelous Doctor.  I'm sorry he couldn't stick around longer (but \nmaybe he would have gone stale).\n\nAnyway, that's a taste of life at Dell Ridge.\n\nAlways glad to hear from you, my oldest friend!\n\nLove,\n\nTodd"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["email", "fields", "v1"]}

The \nthen-named Todd Johnson came into the world as a rather precocious \nmiddle child. Anyone who questions the precocious part has only to read \nsome of the anecdotes in “Dragonholder” to have any doubt removed. He \nspent most of his childhood on the East Coast of the USA until moving to \nDublin, Ireland with his mother and sister in 1970.\n\nLike most of the boys growing up in the ’60s, McCaffrey became space \nmad. However, unlike most of the other young men running around their \nyards in pretend helmets and throwing toy rockets into the air, he was \ngiven a “complete” set of the actual Lunar Module Pilot Study Guides in \n1968. The number of hours spent devouring them repeatedly from cover to \ncover is evident in the fact that he has been known to quote excerpts \nfrom them during convention panels.\n\nWhen the time came for him to pursue higher education, McCaffrey \nattended Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, for a year—and \nhated it. But he did discover one of the great loves of his life while \nhe was there, computers. He graduated with Honors—or rather, \n“Honours”—in 1985 from Trinity College, Dublin.\n\nHaving never lost his love for space, he left Ireland for Los Angeles, \nCalifornia, in the hopes of working in the aerospace industry. However, \nthe computers got him first, and he began working in computer \nprogramming in 1986. He continued to develop his love of space and all \nmechanical things that fly by getting a private pilot’s license in 1988. \nOne interesting side note is the collapse of the aerospace industry in 1989.\n\nDuring this time, his interest in writing also took flight. The sale of \nsome of his early short stories helped him log an impressive amount of \nairtime. He flew across the continent solo in 1989, attending Oshkosh \nalong the way. After quitting his day job in 1990 to write full time, he \nrepeated his solo cross-continent flight and attended the 1990 Oshkosh \nas well.\n\nTodd McCaffrey became a Writers of the Future judge in 2011.\n\n    /“///The Writers of the Future is one of the premier awards that’s\n    available particularly to new writers. It’s basically the only one\n    there. This is a chance to open up the universe to reward people who\n    are trying and striving and succeeding in creating great stories, to\n    reward them with more than just a pat on the back to actually some\n    monetary reward and some recognition and to give them a leg up into\n    the world of a professional writer.///” /—Todd McCaffrey\n\nFind out more at: pernhome.com/tjm/ <http://pernhome.com/tjm/>"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["email", "fields", "v1"]}

Hope this email finds you well, it's been awhile, and \nI pray we all get to meet up at conventions again. <sigh>\n\nIn the meantime, please forgive my shameless promotion here. I'm gunning \nfor recommendations for my last History channel videogame, /Project Blue \nBook/ with little or no guidance and have drummed up this post on the \nSFWA board. For amplification purposes I am sending it out to certain \nSFWA members who may be interested in playing and/or reading the game's \nscript for consideration. Hope you won't mind being on my list. Did you \nhappen to catch the TV series? Well worth watching.\n\nHere is an overview of *Project Blue Book: The Game* with the attached \ngame script for your consideration (as well as some smaller samples) and \nlinks to play the game for free. Enjoy!\n\nThe information below has been posted in its entirety on the Members \nOnly SFWA message boards at the following link, and should be treated \nconfidentially: \nhttps://www.sfwa.org/forum/topic/15951-project-blue-book-the-game-by-steven-elliot-altman-and-julie-marsh/ \n<https://www.sfwa.org/forum/topic/15951-project-blue-book-the-game-by-steven-elliot-altman-and-julie-marsh/>\n\nProject Blue Book The Game Image 2.png\n\nProject Blue Book: The Game by Steven-Elliot Altman and Julie Marsh\n\nPlease find attached the Final Production Draft of Project Blue Book: \nThe Game, which I wrote for A&E Networks based on their History Channel \nseries, along with my clue writer Julie Marsh (Julie was not credited on \nthe game itself, as I was featured, but I am compelled to include her \nfor consideration due to her essential contributions).\n\nI was attempting to bring the genres of television writing and videogame \nwriting one step closer. I was given nearly free reign by the network \nand showrunners on how to proceed, and so decided to write my own \nadaptations of half the game's cases based on produced episodes of the \nTV series (with additional scenes that I envisioned) and the other half \nof the cases as original cases which I based on actual declassified \nU.S.A.F Project Blue Book files.\n\nThe Production Draft encompasses all 9 Cases of Season One of the game. \nBecause this document is quite lengthy I have also attached \"Case 105: \nThe Aztec Recovery\" (in which I introduce J. Robert Oppenheimer to the \ngame's story) and \"Case 107: Project Rainbow\" (in which I \nintroduce Albert Einstein to the game's story, in a story previously \ndramatized as the feature film /The Philadelphia Experiment/) as two \nsmaller samples of the complete work.\n\nBesides the script, the game is FREE TO PLAY as a mobile app available \nfor both IOS and Android phones and tablets in the safe links listed \nbelow, and I invite you to play!\n\nProject Blue Book: The Game on IOS \n<https://apps.apple.com/us/app/project-blue-book-the-game/id1445162277>\n\nProject Blue Book: The Game on Android \n<https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.threegates.projectbluebook&hl=en_US>\n\nAnd for anyone who does not wish to actually play the game, here are \ntwo youtube videos posted by players that depict the game's opening \ntutorial, and the start of CASE 101, The Fuller Dogfight.\n\nProject Blue Book Opening Cut Scene and Tutorial \n<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFhBUpUeqsE&t=5s>\n\nProject Blue Book Case 101 Walkthrough \n<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOhAgdjG7bY&t=23s>\n\nAnd finally, here is the approved description from the app store:\n\nProject Blue Book: The Game is the official, free-to-play, hidden object \nadventure game based on HISTORY’s hit drama series PROJECT BLUE BOOK, \ncreated by David O'Leary, and executive produced by Academy Award and \nGolden Globe® winner Robert Zemeckis. The series explores the \nhistorical, Top Secret investigations into UFOs conducted by the U.S. \nAir Force between 1952 and 1969.\n\nIn Project Blue Book: The Game, you will start off as a newly recruited \nagent in Project Blue Book during the 1950s, under the guidance of the \nshow's lead investigators, Dr. J. Allen Hynek (played by Aidan Gillen \nfrom “Game Of Thrones”), and Captain Michael Quinn (played by Michael \nMalarkey from “The Vampire Diaries”), and begin to investigate real \ndeclassified UFO investigations to find the truth!\n\nHundreds of puzzles, witness interviews and hidden object scenes will \nchallenge your observation and deduction tactics as you investigate \nalongside your favorite characters into many of the cases you loved from \nthe series, uncover exclusive new content, and explore new cases that \ncan only be found in the game!

Here is the situation.\n    The A/C system is one condenser with two internal thermostats, one\n    upstairs and one down stairs. There is a damper, which is movable flap\n    inside the duct work that directs air flow downstair or upstairs\n    depending on the settings of the thermostat.\n\n    At some point in time in the past one of the thermostats was\n    disconnected and so the damper does not adjust airflow, since there is\n    only one thermostat attached.\n\n    I would like to get the second thermostat reconnected and confirm the\n    damper is working correctly to cool both floors as soon as possible.\n\n    As it is right now, the AC is running continuously. Even when the\n    system\n    is turned OFF, the fans still run. When the system is set to COOL, the\n    thermostat setting downstairs has no effect -- and the system runs\n    continuously, without regards to temperature (the temperature has been\n    68 when the thermostat was set to 72), nothing short of turning the AC\n    to OFF on the thermostat effects that (and, as I said, even then the\n    fans continue to run). None of this can be good for the AC system.\n\n    At this very moment, my room temperature is 79.3 degrees which is\n    intolerable.\n\n    I look forward to hearing from you immediately.\n\n    Sincerely,\n    Todd McCaffrey"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["email", "actions", "v1"]}

Convert from manuscript to \"screenplay\" (really, radio play-ish) format.\n\n2. Create audio suitable for ACX.\n\nI've already done a full audiobook with ELLAY (and it's making money!!) \nwhich is why I think this might be a good idea.\n\nI'm willing to pay for the conversion, the output to be in FinalDraft 12 \nformat (.fdx) but, of course, if I think the price is too high, I'll do \nit myself.\n\nFor the audio stuff, the going rate is $250 PFH (per finished hour) \nwhich, quite simply, I can't afford (which is why I was the sole voice \nfor ELLAY). However, perhaps a royalty share?\n\nYou can get a 30-day trial of FinalDraft here <https://finaldraft.com/>. \nAfter that, if things work out, I might include the cost of you getting \nit in our deal.\n\nAttached are the 1 page original and 1 page script format to give you an \nidea of what I want.  The way I handle it, I create SIDES so that I can \nread each voice separately, then the \"general description\" is what I \nread as the narrator. (You wouldn't want to go from the \"screenplay\" \nthat I produce to the screen without editing, that's for sure! <grin>).\n\nAnyway, take a look, let me know if you (and y'all) might be interested!\n\nLove,\n\nTodd"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["email", "intent", "v1"]}

It’s lovely of you to check in, and probably couldn’t come \nat a better time.\nYou asked, so I ain’t gonna hold back. Tune in your big brother \nlistening ears cause your baby sister needs sound advice. I have to \nadmit, I’m not doing too well. Wish I could fluff away, all light and \nbreezy, and tell you ‘I’m grand’ but I’m not. I guess it’s a combination \nof things but, predominantly, living on my own, away from the area I’ve \nknown for over 40 years, is incredibly hard and seems to magnify any \nother difficult issues I experience in my life as a single 60-something. \nIt’s like I’m starting all over again, when I’m already starting over \nagain since my marriage ended. The property market here is a mess, with \nhouses selling far above asking price because there’s a scarcity of \nstock for sale, so I can’t afford to buy anything now and lay down new \nroots. The holding pattern I’m in is excruciating!\n\nAnd I guess other aspects of my life, and the seemingly never-ending \ncrises that are engulfing the earth, are all mixing together to fill my \nplate with a gloomy looking repast. I should stop reading the news.\n\nSleep is difficult; I’ve been wide awake for an hour and it’s not yet \n5am, so this day’s store of resilience is already fecked up. - I have to \ngo to Owen’s girlfriend’s place today to help celebrate the “gender \nreveal” (slap me quick before I gag!) they have planned now that their \ngestating baby is 3 months along. It’ll be the first time I’ll be in the \nsame air space as Geoff since we were in court getting our divorce \ndecree; when I bawled my eyes out in front of everyone whilst giving \ntestimony. Oy! Added to that, Owen has, frankly, been treating me like a \npiece of shit over the last few months so the strain is telling. I’ll be \na big girl, though, go along to see what sex the baby will be and try to \nsmile a lot.\n\nAbout two weeks ago Geoff’s youngest sister, Edel, the main carer for my \n(ex?) mother-in-law, Joan, was in a terrible car crash while travelling \nto Cork for a weekend break with her boyfriend. She’s broken the bones \nin the top of her foot, and two vertebrae just above the tailbone. She \nliterally broke her arse. Poor Mick, her boyfriend, is far worse off and \nwill remain in hospital in Cork for at least another 6 weeks, undergoing \nanother couple of surgeries on top of the 3 he’s already had. Fuck! What \na nightmare, and no visitors allowed to see him. Poor guy.\n\nAnd then a totally strange series of things have occurred recently with \nregard to my late sister-in-law’s husband, Noel. He’s a very successful \nbusinessman and a pub owner and has been trying to cope with the sudden \ndeath of his wife in June 2019, along with the grief their two (young) \nadult kids are experiencing, plus the lack of pub business due to Covid.\n\nI’ve kept in loose touch with Noel ever since he asked me to write and \ndeliver Maria’s eulogy. Over the last couple of years, through texts, \nhe’s always suggested that we get together for a drink and catch up \nwhich I’ve always put down as pure politeness. Recently he suggested the \nsame thing but in a phone call when he told me about Edel’s crash, which \nno one else in the Kennedy clan had informed me of.\n\nEdel has always been close to Noel and she asked him to drive to Cork to \nbe with her whilst she gave an official report to the Gardai regarding \nthe crash. So here’s where it gets weird, Tig. Noel asked me to drive \nwith him to Cork to collect Edel but suggested we go down the day before \nher release, have a nice meal, a few drinks and “a laugh”, and stay the \nnight in an hotel before we retrieve Edel the following day. Whilst he \nwas suggesting this plan I was uncommonly quiet on the other end of the \nphone and Noel said we would, of course, have separate rooms because he \n“wasn’t going to try and climb into bed with me”. The thought never \ncrossed my mind! To be honest, I wasn’t sure what the fuck was going on \nbut it’s been a very long time since I’ve been in the company of a kind \nman who wanted to hang out with me, so I agreed, thinking what harm \ncould come of it.\n\nAt any rate, as it turned out, Edel didn’t have to have an interview \nwith the Gardai in Cork and without discussing it with me, Noel changed \nhis initial plan ‘to have a laugh’, and we simply drove to and from Cork \non the same day to collect Edel. I reckon he possibly had a good think \nabout what he’d proposed and decided against it. We had a pleasant time \ntalking on the way down to Cork but I couldn’t forget the fact that I’m \nfairly certain he’d possibly made a pass at me. Or did he? I have no clue.\n\nSo my silly girl head can’t stop thinking about this, and Noel. In fact, \nit’s wrecking my head, and living alone doesn’t help; I already spend \n*way* too much time in my own head. I keep scolding myself to stop! but \nI’m lonely, and would like a man to like me again. I guess I’m just \ngoing to have to let time do it’s magical thing and allow it all to \nslowly fade away. Talk to me, Todd. Give me your take on this. Sorry \nthis is so long but, hell! I’m long-winded.\n\nLove,\nSkin\n\nSent from my iPad"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["email", "fields", "v1"]}

Moving is also a major change.  \nCovid is a major change.  You've got a lot of stressors in your life.  \nRecovering from a divorce takes about two years.\n\nI started re-watching Dr. Who and Grey's Anatomy and Gilmore Girls as my \ncovid fix.\n\nI also had a blast watching \"Enola Holmes\" which confirmed my belief \nthat Millie Bobby Brown is a terrific actor (the film spent a lot of \ntime breaking the fourth wall in all sorts of marvelous manners).\n\nI was severely disappointed with WW84. I didn't think all that much of \nMandolorian either, although the ending was fun. I did have fun and do \nrecommend the Apple TV show, \"Home Before Dark.\" Seriously good acting \nall around.\n\nI splurged and got myself a really nice 34\" curved monitor and for \nHannukah got a Amazon Roku firestick which means I get to watch 4k TV up \nclose and personal.\n\nNew Year's Eve I took a shower and scratched an itchy ankle with the toe \nof my other foot -- and got it all infected.  By the second I was in an \nUrgent Care getting a prescription for Keflex which is a staph specific \nantibiotic.  I'm doing much better but I was appalled at how quickly the \ninfection spread.\n\nI am taking some Domestika courses, some on Photoshop, some on Book \nCover Design, and all sorts of things.  They're mostly in Spanish with \nsubtitles but I'm having fun.\n\nI also signed up for Dean Wesley Smith's and Kristine Kathryn Rusch's \n\"The Decade Ahead\" bundle with the challenge of looking forward to 2029.\n\nDex and I speak semi-frequently.  He called me the other day to say that \nJenna had totaled her car in a roll over accident.  I, of course, \nimmediately recalled your Glen of the Downs accident.   She's okay but I \nasked her (via text) to be worried about possible concussions. (I \nattached a photo of her poor car.)\n\nI don't know what's up with Alec.  He recently asked me if I still had \n\"Mom's old chess set\" and would I part with it.  I had Bami's old chess \nset which Bami very specifically willed to me and no, I was not going to \npart with it.\n\nHe does seem committed to being in the right about his incident in Texas \nwhich is alarmingly similar to the behavior of certain Presidents I \ncould name.\n\nComing up soon, I get to apply for Medicare which is a bit more involved \nthan I'd imagined.\n\nI'm re-reading the /Bloody Jack/ series once again.  I started looking \nat the first book and just got caught up with the whole thing. It really \nwas a lot of fun and it'd make a great TV series.\n\nHere's hoping to a vaccinated New Year!\n\nLove,\nTodd"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["email", "fields", "v1"]}

Here is the situation. \nThe A/C system is one condenser with two internal thermostats, one \nupstairs and one down stairs. There is a damper, which is movable flap \ninside the duct work that directs air flow downstair or upstairs \ndepending on the settings of the thermostat.\n\nAt some point in time in the past one of the thermostats was \ndisconnected and so the damper does not adjust airflow, since there is \nonly one thermostat attached.\n\nI would like to get the second thermostat reconnected and confirm the \ndamper is working correctly to cool both floors as soon as possible.\n\nAs it is right now, the AC is running continuously. Even when the system \nis turned OFF, the fans still run. When the system is set to COOL, the \nthermostat setting downstairs has no effect -- and the system runs \ncontinuously, without regards to temperature (the temperature has been \n68 when the thermostat was set to 72), nothing short of turning the AC \nto OFF on the thermostat effects that (and, as I said, even then the \nfans continue to run). None of this can be good for the AC system.\n\nAt this very moment, my room temperature is 79.3 degrees which is \nintolerable.\n\nI look forward to hearing from you immediately.\n\nSincerely,\nTodd McCaffrey"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["email", "summary", "v1"]}

Create audio suitable for ACX.\n\nI've already done a full audiobook with ELLAY (and it's making money!!) \nwhich is why I think this might be a good idea.\n\nI'm willing to pay for the conversion, the output to be in FinalDraft 12 \nformat (.fdx) but, of course, if I think the price is too high, I'll do \nit myself.\n\nFor the audio stuff, the going rate is $250 PFH (per finished hour) \nwhich, quite simply, I can't afford (which is why I was the sole voice \nfor ELLAY). However, perhaps a royalty share?\n\nYou can get a 30-day trial of FinalDraft here <https://finaldraft.com/>. \nAfter that, if things work out, I might include the cost of you getting \nit in our deal.\n\nAttached are the 1 page original and 1 page script format to give you an \nidea of what I want.  The way I handle it, I create SIDES so that I can \nread each voice separately, then the \"general description\" is what I \nread as the narrator. (You wouldn't want to go from the \"screenplay\" \nthat I produce to the screen without editing, that's for sure! <grin>).\n\nAnyway, take a look, let me know if you (and y'all) might be interested!\n\nLove,\n\nTodd"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["email", "actions", "v1"]}

It doesn’t just come from our parents. It comes from our \ncommunity, our society, from the people we grow up with.\n\nI am an alien, so I think my point of view may be helpful. When I say \nI’m an alien, I’m an alien in Ireland: where I lived for my high school \nand college years. I describe myself as “mid-Atlantic and sinking.”\n\nMy journey toward racism started in late elementary and early middle \nschool, before I moved to Ireland.\n\nI moved to Long Island, New York, in time to enter third grade. The \nschool was small and the community tight-knit. There were only two black \nkids in the whole school — they were brothers, a year apart. Nice guys. \nThe younger one had a small bit of iris detached in the white of his eye \nwhich amazed everyone who saw it.  I remember constantly asking to look \nat it — it was just so cool!\n\nMy parents were determined to raise broad-minded children and when the \nchance came, introduced us to people from all  over the world, including \na Nigerian who stayed the weekend with us, arriving in the marvelously \nbright Nigerian native clothing.\n\nStill, in school hallways, there were the whispers. That blacks would \nbeat kids up, that you couldn’t trust them.\n\nThis whispering became more apparent in middle school and I think, had \nit not been for my relocation to Ireland, that background whispering \nwould have lodged firmly in my mind.\n\nBut, barring that lingering underlayer of fear, I like to think that the \nfull implant of racism didn’t take with me.  And I think that’s because \nof my time in Ireland… and two people in particular.\n\nIn Ireland my classmates said: “I hate all Yanks!” to which was hastily \nadded, “But not you, I know you.”  Such statements are examples of \nprejudice and bigotry. It was my first experience of prejudice directed \nat me.\n\nThe two people who broke the back of racism for me were strangers.  One \nwas a classmate, the other an actor.\n\nWe’ll take the second first.  He is Lenny Henry — now SirLenny Henry.  \nHe is a black comedian. Hearing a very English accent on a black man \nbroke the mold that society had tried to impose on me about black people \n— that they all spoke the same.  That was a revelation to me, a “Wait, \nwhat?” moment. Not all blacks are the same.  My fourteen year-old \nthinking went like this: “So… this notion that blacks are a threat or \nmenace… that’s a lie!”\n\nMy second revelation came with my classmate, Obudan Obesan. Obudan, for \nme, will always be the primal proof that skin color means \nabsolutelynothing!  Also, he proved that James Joyce was a second-rate \nauthor. I can’t remember when we read Joyce’s The Dubliners.  I’m pretty \nsure it was after I’d first been exposed to Mr. Obesan’s writing.  The \nthing is, Obudan gotthe feel of the Irish, the Dublin Irish, down pat.  \nHe had it better than Joyce. Waayyybetter than Joyce. Nearly fifty years \nlater, my opinion has not changed.\n\nBetween Obudan and Sir Lenny Henry, I threw out that notion that black \npeople were inferior.\n\nWith the benefit of hindsight, I can see how American society has a \nbuilt-in underlying prejudice against people of color.  It starts as the \nwhispers in middle grade and high school corridors: “You can’t trust \nthem.” “They’ll beat you up.” It’s something that we should be aware of, \nshould recognize... and banish.\n\nBecause black culture has imbued our society with somuch. Even while we \nderided it, it gave us rock’n’roll, starting with Chuck Berry. The black \nculture is more vibrant and alive than the old, tired white culture. We \ncan and should learn a lot from it.  The first step is to recognize \nthat. The next step is to embrace this difference, to grasp it and learn \nfrom it. Our society will grow stronger when we do.\n\n*"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["email", "summary", "v1"]}

The explosives were \nsparklers for a school science project.)\n\nI figured that it was such a good starting premise that I just /had/ to \nwrite the novel.\n\nAnyway, one of my tertiary characters decided that, as she was going to \ngene-engineer her own child, she would name him from her favorite \n\"pre-space\" science fiction series.  And so, currently Engisn Millisor \nRau is serving on HMAS Sparkle (laundry ship for the Navy).  He also \nbecomes the OCTO - Officer Candidate Training Officer - for one of my \nheroines, the girl who turned him down when she was a teenager (/Oh, \ndamn, the one boy I've ever broke and he's my commanding officer!)/\n\nObviously, it's an homage on my part.  If it causes you grief, then I \ncan change the name but I hope it meets with you approval.\n\nCheers,\n\nTodd McCaffrey"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["email", "intent", "v1"]}

I'm sure you've already addressed this even though it doesn't \nshow up in the version I downloaded.  Just throwing this out there since \nI did observe it.\n\n*Chapter12*\nLocation 4956 - typo... her, not his .../Margaret replied cheerfully, \nbounding out of /her /seat./\n\nLocation 5107 - awkward sentence, not sure if you meant to say ./..relay \na stream of conscious report of an SC that *is* thinking very loudly/ or \npossibly /...relay a stream of conscious report of an SC that *thinks* \nvery loudly /or /if it's ...conscious report *to* an SC.../\n\nLocation 5147 - typo... I, not If  (*I* believe that it will be more \nmeaningful...)\n\nLocation 5188 - typo... insert \"would\" (But what *would* you do in my \nposition?)\n\nLocation 5217 - typo... Clio, not Cio\n\nLocation 5243 - not sure that *nearly* fits here unless it is supposed \nto be *just*. Maybe omit it completely? (...looked to Owami for \nconfirmation, but Owami nearly waved her back to Cona).\n\nLocation 5347 - typo... on, not off (...co-pilot's hands so that they \nwere centered *on* the self-destruct button...)\n\nLocation 5425 - \"Admirals Branford\" isn't correct. Janis is not a \nBranford, but he is an Admiral.\n\n*Chapter 13*\nLocation 5572 - when onboard the ships, the British word lift is used.  \nActually, I think it works fine.  Just pointing out the use of British \nEnglish.\n\nLocation 5588 -  May not be anything but... /You've been requested to go \nTDY to the NWC for the next week./ Not quite sure what this means. Is \nTDY Training Duty?  If so, my mind would read it better as /You've been \nrequested to *do* TDY *at* the NWC for the next week./  Maybe this is \nhow they speak and my non-military mind just has problems.\n\nLocation 5739 - Comma needed for If/then sentence: /Because if she were \npicked*,***it'd mean that.../\n\nLocation 5817 - typo... planted, not planet (...and by whom that \nbacterial assault was *planted* on Sparkle)\n\nLocation 5858 - typo... Rochelle, not Rachel\n\nLocation 5935 - Insert \"said\"... Fromer *said* as he strolled...\n\n*Chapter 14*\nLocation 5962: typo... The, not They (*The* four of them fit..)\n\n*Chapter 15*\nLocation 6488: tonnes - is it British for tons? (...there's /tonnes/ \nwe're not seeing). I may have seen this somewhere else, but not sure if \nit was in this book or the first one, /Raw Space/.\n\nLocation 6724 - is this a typo... she, not he or is there someone else \nOwami is referring to? (She didn't want to joggle the Major's arm while \n*she* was conducing the assault...)\n\nLocation 6744 - typo... her, not him (Cona sent in *her* first team...)\n\nLocation 6772 - typo... her, not his (/Clip/, Cona ordered and *her* \nreserve squad moved out...)\n\nLocation 6824 - typo... outsider should be plural (... the name used \nwith *outsiders* for /The King's Own Ghosts...)/\n\n*Chapter 16*\nLocation 6966 (2nd paragraph of chapter) - This is a very long sentence. \nSuggestions: 1) move the comma from before to after \"Scotty\" and 2)  \ndrop the \"when\" along with the comma and put a period after Munchkin\n\nLocation 7032 - typo... on, not own (\"So put her *on* alert,\" Rochelle \nsaid.)\n\nLocation 7088 - same confusing working for me: ...cadets were with us \nTDY to the NWC...  Guess it's just me.\n\nLocation 7159 - typo... Morton has a \"w\" on the end\n\n*Chapter 17*\nLocation 7227 - typo whether, not when (... hard pressed to say \n*whether* her bedmate was male, female, or something else.)\n\nLocation 7244 - The math doesn't work. If Neff's sun is 700,000 times \nlarger than Canaris Prime, it would be 14 million km in diameter, not \n1.4 km.  For 1.4 million km diameter, it would only be 70,000 times \nlarger. (FYI - I did not check the mass calculations.)\n\nLocation 7279 - 1) typo... *Ophelia* is not possessive and 2) delete \n\"said even\" (...kneeling down to Ophelia's said even as she hit...)\n\nThat's all I have for you Todd.  Hope I didn't get this to you too late.\nSusan"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["email", "summary", "v1"]}

Her mounting anger and vengeance didn't have any \nrational background to support them and her unwillingness to listen to \nreason or learn finally killed any sympathy I might have had for her.\n\nI also questioned the setting -- was this in the 1970s? 80s? 90s? \nEarlier? Later?\n\nGinny's love for her mare didn't work for me. I grew up with horse mad \ngirls, and Ginny didn't fit.  It seemed to me that her horse was at \nabout the same level in her affections as a rusted hand-me-down bicycle.\n\nI began to notice the number of chapters.  There's an *awful* lot of them.\n\nI also wasn't sure about the farm -- was it a cattle farm? Dairy? Crop? \nMixed use?  That question nagged at me and helped pull me out of the book.\n\nCheers,\nTodd McCaffrey\n\nP.S.: The YA/Middle Grade books that I read include:\n\nAlly Carter's /The Gallagher Girls/ \n<https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000S1LF5K>\nalso Ally Carter's Winterborne Home for Vengeance and Valor \n<https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07T4HQR9D>\nAlan Bradley started a marvelous series about an eleven year-old sleuth \nwith The Sweetness at the Bottom of the Pie \n<https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0027G6XDS>\nL.A.

It doesn’t just come from our parents. It comes from our \ncommunity, our society, from the people we grow up with.\n\nI am an alien, so I think my point of view may be helpful. When I say \nI’m an alien, I’m an alien in Ireland: where I lived for my high school \nand college years. I describe myself as “mid-Atlantic and sinking.”\n\nMy journey toward racism started in late elementary and early middle \nschool, before I moved to Ireland.\n\nI moved to Long Island, New York, in time to enter third grade. The \nschool was small and the community tight-knit. There were only two black \nkids in the whole school — they were brothers, a year apart. Nice guys. \nThe younger one had a small bit of iris detached in the white of his eye \nwhich amazed everyone who saw it.  I remember constantly asking to look \nat it — it was just so cool!\n\nMy parents were determined to raise broad-minded children and when the \nchance came, introduced us to people from all  over the world, including \na Nigerian who stayed the weekend with us, arriving in the marvelously \nbright Nigerian native clothing.\n\nStill, in school hallways, there were the whispers. That blacks would \nbeat kids up, that you couldn’t trust them.\n\nThis whispering became more apparent in middle school and I think, had \nit not been for my relocation to Ireland, that background whispering \nwould have lodged firmly in my mind.\n\nBut, barring that lingering underlayer of fear, I like to think that the \nfull implant of racism didn’t take with me.  And I think that’s because \nof my time in Ireland… and two people in particular.\n\nIn Ireland my classmates said: “I hate all Yanks!” to which was hastily \nadded, “But not you, I know you.”  Such statements are examples of \nprejudice and bigotry. It was my first experience of prejudice directed \nat me.\n\nThe two people who broke the back of racism for me were strangers.  One \nwas a classmate, the other an actor.\n\nWe’ll take the second first.  He is Lenny Henry — now SirLenny Henry.  \nHe is a black comedian. Hearing a very English accent on a black man \nbroke the mold that society had tried to impose on me about black people \n— that they all spoke the same.  That was a revelation to me, a “Wait, \nwhat?” moment. Not all blacks are the same.  My fourteen year-old \nthinking went like this: “So… this notion that blacks are a threat or \nmenace… that’s a lie!”\n\nMy second revelation came with my classmate, Obudan Obesan. Obudan, for \nme, will always be the primal proof that skin color means \nabsolutelynothing!  Also, he proved that James Joyce was a second-rate \nauthor. I can’t remember when we read Joyce’s The Dubliners.  I’m pretty \nsure it was after I’d first been exposed to Mr. Obesan’s writing.  The \nthing is, Obudan gotthe feel of the Irish, the Dublin Irish, down pat.  \nHe had it better than Joyce. Waayyybetter than Joyce. Nearly fifty years \nlater, my opinion has not changed.\n\nBetween Obudan and Sir Lenny Henry, I threw out that notion that black \npeople were inferior.\n\nWith the benefit of hindsight, I can see how American society has a \nbuilt-in underlying prejudice against people of color.  It starts as the \nwhispers in middle grade and high school corridors: “You can’t trust \nthem.” “They’ll beat you up.” It’s something that we should be aware of, \nshould recognize... and banish.\n\nBecause black culture has imbued our society with somuch. Even while we \nderided it, it gave us rock’n’roll, starting with Chuck Berry. The black \nculture is more vibrant and alive than the old, tired white culture. We \ncan and should learn a lot from it.  The first step is to recognize \nthat. The next step is to embrace this difference, to grasp it and learn \nfrom it. Our society will grow stronger when we do.\n\n*"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["email", "draft_or_rewrite", "v1"]}

Cloud Conqueror (Twin Soul Series #2)\n\n2. The Jupiter Game (that's me)\n\nThe idea is:\n\n1. Convert from manuscript to \"screenplay\" (really, radio play-ish) format.\n\n2. Create audio suitable for ACX.\n\nI've already done a full audiobook with ELLAY (and it's making money!!) \nwhich is why I think this might be a good idea.\n\nI'm willing to pay for the conversion, the output to be in FinalDraft 12 \nformat (.fdx) but, of course, if I think the price is too high, I'll do \nit myself.\n\nFor the audio stuff, the going rate is $250 PFH (per finished hour) \nwhich, quite simply, I can't afford (which is why I was the sole voice \nfor ELLAY). However, perhaps a royalty share?\n\nYou can get a 30-day trial of FinalDraft here <https://finaldraft.com/>. \nAfter that, if things work out, I might include the cost of you getting \nit in our deal.\n\nAttached are the 1 page original and 1 page script format to give you an \nidea of what I want.  The way I handle it, I create SIDES so that I can \nread each voice separately, then the \"general description\" is what I \nread as the narrator. (You wouldn't want to go from the \"screenplay\" \nthat I produce to the screen without editing, that's for sure! <grin>).\n\nAnyway, take a look, let me know if you (and y'all) might be interested!\n\nLove,\n\nTodd"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["email", "fields", "v1"]}

It’s lovely of you to check in, and probably couldn’t come \nat a better time.\nYou asked, so I ain’t gonna hold back. Tune in your big brother \nlistening ears cause your baby sister needs sound advice. I have to \nadmit, I’m not doing too well. Wish I could fluff away, all light and \nbreezy, and tell you ‘I’m grand’ but I’m not. I guess it’s a combination \nof things but, predominantly, living on my own, away from the area I’ve \nknown for over 40 years, is incredibly hard and seems to magnify any \nother difficult issues I experience in my life as a single 60-something. \nIt’s like I’m starting all over again, when I’m already starting over \nagain since my marriage ended. The property market here is a mess, with \nhouses selling far above asking price because there’s a scarcity of \nstock for sale, so I can’t afford to buy anything now and lay down new \nroots. The holding pattern I’m in is excruciating!\n\nAnd I guess other aspects of my life, and the seemingly never-ending \ncrises that are engulfing the earth, are all mixing together to fill my \nplate with a gloomy looking repast. I should stop reading the news.\n\nSleep is difficult; I’ve been wide awake for an hour and it’s not yet \n5am, so this day’s store of resilience is already fecked up. - I have to \ngo to Owen’s girlfriend’s place today to help celebrate the “gender \nreveal” (slap me quick before I gag!) they have planned now that their \ngestating baby is 3 months along. It’ll be the first time I’ll be in the \nsame air space as Geoff since we were in court getting our divorce \ndecree; when I bawled my eyes out in front of everyone whilst giving \ntestimony. Oy! Added to that, Owen has, frankly, been treating me like a \npiece of shit over the last few months so the strain is telling. I’ll be \na big girl, though, go along to see what sex the baby will be and try to \nsmile a lot.\n\nAbout two weeks ago Geoff’s youngest sister, Edel, the main carer for my \n(ex?) mother-in-law, Joan, was in a terrible car crash while travelling \nto Cork for a weekend break with her boyfriend. She’s broken the bones \nin the top of her foot, and two vertebrae just above the tailbone. She \nliterally broke her arse. Poor Mick, her boyfriend, is far worse off and \nwill remain in hospital in Cork for at least another 6 weeks, undergoing \nanother couple of surgeries on top of the 3 he’s already had. Fuck! What \na nightmare, and no visitors allowed to see him. Poor guy.\n\nAnd then a totally strange series of things have occurred recently with \nregard to my late sister-in-law’s husband, Noel. He’s a very successful \nbusinessman and a pub owner and has been trying to cope with the sudden \ndeath of his wife in June 2019, along with the grief their two (young) \nadult kids are experiencing, plus the lack of pub business due to Covid.\n\nI’ve kept in loose touch with Noel ever since he asked me to write and \ndeliver Maria’s eulogy. Over the last couple of years, through texts, \nhe’s always suggested that we get together for a drink and catch up \nwhich I’ve always put down as pure politeness. Recently he suggested the \nsame thing but in a phone call when he told me about Edel’s crash, which \nno one else in the Kennedy clan had informed me of.\n\nEdel has always been close to Noel and she asked him to drive to Cork to \nbe with her whilst she gave an official report to the Gardai regarding \nthe crash. So here’s where it gets weird, Tig. Noel asked me to drive \nwith him to Cork to collect Edel but suggested we go down the day before \nher release, have a nice meal, a few drinks and “a laugh”, and stay the \nnight in an hotel before we retrieve Edel the following day. Whilst he \nwas suggesting this plan I was uncommonly quiet on the other end of the \nphone and Noel said we would, of course, have separate rooms because he \n“wasn’t going to try and climb into bed with me”. The thought never \ncrossed my mind! To be honest, I wasn’t sure what the fuck was going on \nbut it’s been a very long time since I’ve been in the company of a kind \nman who wanted to hang out with me, so I agreed, thinking what harm \ncould come of it.\n\nAt any rate, as it turned out, Edel didn’t have to have an interview \nwith the Gardai in Cork and without discussing it with me, Noel changed \nhis initial plan ‘to have a laugh’, and we simply drove to and from Cork \non the same day to collect Edel. I reckon he possibly had a good think \nabout what he’d proposed and decided against it. We had a pleasant time \ntalking on the way down to Cork but I couldn’t forget the fact that I’m \nfairly certain he’d possibly made a pass at me. Or did he? I have no clue.\n\nSo my silly girl head can’t stop thinking about this, and Noel. In fact, \nit’s wrecking my head, and living alone doesn’t help; I already spend \n*way* too much time in my own head. I keep scolding myself to stop! but \nI’m lonely, and would like a man to like me again. I guess I’m just \ngoing to have to let time do it’s magical thing and allow it all to \nslowly fade away. Talk to me, Todd. Give me your take on this. Sorry \nthis is so long but, hell! I’m long-winded.\n\nLove,\nSkin\n\nSent from my iPad"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}], "tags": ["email", "actions", "v1"]}
